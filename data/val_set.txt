droll imitation of may chester’s gushing style that amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible, feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time. amy knew her good points, and made the

art nearest her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an indian in full war costume, tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open. i’ll be as prim as i can and not get into any scrapes, if i can help it. be calm, girls, and let me think. yet there are a thousand ways of helping them, if one only knows how to do it so

and innocent romances of a girlish heart. then she tried a child’s story, which she could easily have disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy lucre for it. as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sister’s pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things. it was not fair, for she tried more than amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment, trouble and hard work. dear heart, how fast you do grow up,” returned her mother with a sigh and a smile. what shall we do about that?” asked jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to the very dull task of doing her duty. org/contact

amy was off. “yes, you will!” persisted jo. i know it, madame confides in me. i wasn’t meant for a life like this, and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesn’t come and help me,” she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable. everyone seemed

nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like a brother. there probably were a good many happy little girls in and about the city that day, but it is my private opinion that amy was the happiest of all, when she sat in her mother’s lap and told her trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of approving smiles and fond caresses. and looking at them with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember that they too may miss the blossom time. he did not give the complacent wraith any name, but he took her for his heroine and grew quite fond of her, as

mountains. ” as she spoke, amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it. “we can’t give up our girls for a dozen fortunes. oh, jo, how could you do it?” and meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her heart were quite broken. weary hannah slept on, and no one but the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the little bed. “is i wounded up like the watch?” “yes, but i can’t show you how, for it is done when we don’t see. ” so cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow beth seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads nor hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills. ” no answer for an instant, then laurie asked sharply, “who told you?” “jo herself. i shall tell him i’ve made up my mind, and shall walk out of the room with dignity. “getting leaves,” meekly answered jo, sorting the rosy handful she had just

letters, and i made her tell me. she had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble. so laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly lively humor, for to the marches he seldom showed the moody side of his character. all day she haunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her. “if john doesn’t know anything about this nonsense, don’t tell him, and make jo and laurie hold their tongues. it will please her very much, i know,” said meg, with a frown for jo and a smile for beth.

jo’s favorite lounging place. i feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common. ” jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, “that’s a splendid polka! why don’t you go and try it?” “if you will come too,” he answered, with a gallant little bow. it’s very funny when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical comical stuff to laugh over. while apparently absorbed in her own affairs, jo watched beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. “i say, isn’t bread ‘riz’ enough when it runs over the pans?” sallie began to laugh, but meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows as high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and put the sour bread into the oven without further delay. march gently told meg mr. ” “oh, dear, no! it will

she sat with every limb gracefully composed, every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank, and as silent as the sphinx. march, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system. another chant from hagar produced another apparition, not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and, having croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at hugo and disappeared with a mocking laugh. “i wish i was a horse, then i could run for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath. oh, i can’t begin to tell you how i enjoy it all! i never can, so i’ll only give you bits out of my notebook, for i’ve done nothing but sketch and scribble since

cold to him. how could you? when will you stop such romping ways?” said meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties. “what do you know about his eyes and his manners? you never spoke to him, hardly,” cried jo, who was not sentimental. it’s my turn now,” said jo sharply. “mother, i’m going to work mr. “thank you! i’ve read all those,

great instrument, and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like the voice of a beloved friend. brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take. some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties as bribes, but demi didn’t see it in that light, and continued to patronize the ‘the bear-man’ with pensive affability, while daisy bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call, and considered his shoulder her

no one to go about with me, so i just stop at home and get on as i can. “not a bit. i love it dearly, and i’ll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,” she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke. i pray he may, and try to be all he believes me, for i love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and might, and never will desert him, while god lets us be together. what happy times they had planning together, what solemn shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what shouts of laughter arose over laurie’s ridiculous bargains. i thank you all the same. he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls. ” “i see. “has your highness seen the lady viola tonight?” asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who floated down the hall upon his arm. be patient, jo, don’t get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to help and cheer all. i’ve been through something of it, and i know all about it. creating the works from print editions not protected by u. as the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their best just now. “i’d take it manfully, and be respected if i couldn’t be loved,” said amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it. ” jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder as they parted for the day, each going a different way, each hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth. ” “‘cabbages!’” continued laurie promptly. ” “well, you can’t, there isn’t room. am i? can you make a little place in your heart for old fritz?” he added, all in one breath. march was very busy trying to finish a letter, which must go at once, and hannah had the grumps, for being up late didn’t suit her. home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings. “my lady,” as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks. “now, we must finish with mignon’s song, for mr. indeed, a general impression had prevailed in the family of late that ‘our boy’ was getting fonder than ever of jo, who, however, wouldn’t hear a word upon the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it. i can do more, for even your ambitious soul cannot refuse the earl of devereux and de vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady, now my wife. ” all eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom removed their masks. colonel teddy dear madam: the little girls are all well. everything was arranged by the time laurie returned with a note from aunt march, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines repeating what she had often said before, that she had always told them it was absurd for march to go into the army, always predicted that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her advice the next time. ” laurie had vanished round the bend, jo was just at the turn, and amy, far behind, striking out toward the smoother ice in the middle of the river. then he stayed away for three whole days, and made no sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and jo to become pensive, at first, and then—alas for romance—very cross. “it’s my dreadful temper! i try to cure it, i think i have, and then it breaks out worse than ever. give us the cold meat, and bread and cheese. “that i’m not!” acquiesced laurie, with an expression of humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently wound jo’s apron tassel round his finger. a stout little retainer came in with chains and led them away, looking very much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to have made. “i don’t believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough to wear them. “sorry you could find nothing better to read. ” “they do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest, you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they, every bit. ” “what then?” “my. “you, you are, you’re a great deal too good for me, and i’m so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, i don’t know why i can’t love you as you want me to. ” amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked at her husband, who replied, with malicious gravity. “how do you know i do, miss?” “i can always tell by his face when he goes away. ” “i forgot young ladies in america go to school more than with us. he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away. “yes, i want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine needles, and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon. ” “i never do. ” a week later amy did get her reward, and poor jo found it hard to be delighted. ” there was plenty of food in the larder, and while beth and amy set the table, meg and jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work. in a postscript she desired him not to tell amy that beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay. she put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout way to the road. amy’s dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed may’s painted vases—that was one thorn. “she’s coming! strike up, beth! open the door, amy! three cheers for marmee!” cried jo, prancing about while meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor. “that’s it!” said jo to herself, when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward one’s fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of bhaer. you think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine used to be just like it. march smoothed the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly. pickwick, _sir:_— i address you upon the subject of sin the sinner i mean is a man named winkle who makes trouble in his club by laughing and sometimes won’t write his piece in this fine paper i hope you will pardon his badness and let him send a french fable

all right i am in haste as it is nearly school time. “shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this?” asked jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and emboldened by her success. i’ll do anything for you, jo, if you’ll only dress yourself nicely, and come and help me do the civil. “why didn’t you let us know afterward?” asked jo, in a quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute. if it’s fine, i’m going to pitch my tent in longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and croquet—have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts of larks. everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down. how queer that he should come. ” meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely, “you are very kind, but i’m afraid he won’t come. “it is an excellent plan to have some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex or grieve us. ” a demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. better for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper. i knew you were busy about your own affairs, but we rather missed you, father and mother especially. think what luxury— plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me. besides, the best have to get through the hobbledehoy age, and that’s the very time they need most patience and kindness. the bridegroom’s hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies. ” “i wouldn’t leave a word out of it. i liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, i sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion’s head on the wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend’s good. will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?” “yes, sir,” and jo felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if she had stepped into a refrigerator. home came four dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small boy to pick the currants for her. “here’s the place for my errands. i often shake you, and you don’t mind,” said jo soothingly. i am proud of you, teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone feels it, though you won’t let them say so. the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew ‘so heavy’, was still on its accustomed shelf. i met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. and mrs. “not the least, my dear,” interrupted jo, “so let us look amiable, and drop a card here, as the kings are evidently out, for which i’m deeply grateful. hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. march was when she knew it. ” “now, laurie, don’t be too fastidious and worldly-minded. it quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it immensely. “a characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,” returned laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming with satisfaction. of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them. the best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in love. and jo wouldn’t be kind to you? why, i was sure she loved you dearly. eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents, incidents, and crimes. he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again; and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother’s face. ” “where will you hop?” “to new york. there was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going on. i turned my foot a little, that’s all,” and limped upstairs to put her things on. work is wholesome, and there is plenty for everyone. “you spend a great deal, teddy. come, then, and take a goot hug from him, my tina,” said the professor, catching her up with a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she had to stoop her little face to kiss him. ” “well, i think truth is a very silly play. but i am not miss march, i’m only jo,” returned the young lady. ” “i wish you wouldn’t. a few days before she had done a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience. at thirty they say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if sensible, console themselves by remembering that they have twenty more useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow old gracefully. you ought to make an effort and go visiting everywhere you are asked, then you’ll have plenty of friends, and pleasant places to go to. my eye is on you, so mind what you do, or i’ll come and bring you home. ” “that’s

mother’s, and with a little interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one than ever. ’ it was very lovely, but i

full, full for her. ” they were soon ready, and the procession set out. she rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to mr. so taught by love and sorrow, jo wrote her little stories, and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother, like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes. an evening with john over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. “what have you been at today, bubchen?” asked mr. “it isn’t low-necked, and it doesn’t sweep enough, but it will have to do. “what a sly fellow laurie is! i said i wished bigger hats were the fashion, because i burn my face every hot day. in the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that hannah had put the tea ‘to draw’, and they would just have time to get home to supper. “john is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn to see and bear with them, remembering your own. ” “you won’t give anyone a chance,” said laurie, with a sidelong glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face. “i was reading that everlasting belsham, and droning away as i always do, for aunt soon drops off, and then i take out some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up. lie down here and ‘poor’ my head. act third was the castle hall, and here hagar appeared, having come to free the lovers and finish hugo. i’ve seen the imperial family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, i thought—purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. there are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. “my wife and i are very glad to meet you, sir. laurie didn’t tell us that. ” beth went to the piano and played the father’s favorite hymn. “it’s evident daisy isn’t out yet,” said miss clara to belle with a nod. “everything is out of sorts, somehow,” she said to herself, going downstairs. grundy will observe, “i don’t believe it, boys will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats, and women must not expect miracles. i was so glad of that. he did it so quietly that jo never knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was satisfied, for though no words passed between them, he knew that she had given up writing. ” “you?” cried meg, dropping her work. then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully. but both felt ill at ease. “no, dear, not you. i’m only afraid you are very tired of talking to me. “never mind. as i went downstairs soon after, i saw something i liked. ” “isn’t there some nice girl who’d read and amuse you? girls are quiet and like to play nurse. i promised i would, and he departed, but it seems as if i was doomed to see a good deal of him, for today as i passed his door on my way out, by accident i knocked against it with my umbrella. touching, isn’t it?” answered jo scornfully. “i shall go to my kings, though i’d much rather stay at home and attend to things here,” said meg, wishing she hadn’t made her eyes so red. never mind, it saves trouble now. then she could not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a dozen times a day. “you and i will be twenty-six, teddy, beth twenty-four, and amy twenty-two. “all wrong. teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were ‘daisy’ and ‘demi’ to the end of the chapter. no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. a rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul was daisy, who found her way to everybody’s heart, and nestled there. ” “i’m not so silly and weak as you think. “there’s beth crying, that’s a sure sign that something is wrong in this family. “are you sure she is safe?” whispered jo, looking remorsefully at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice. “can i do anything for you, madam mother?” asked laurie, leaning over mrs. i admire to do it, and you’d be a regular little beauty with a touch here and there. “yes, out it came, and away ran polly, frightened to death, and scrambled up on aunt’s chair, calling out, ‘catch her! catch her! catch her!’ as i chased the spider. ” “you’re highly satisfactory. jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to whistle. that night, when beth played to mr. the set in which they found themselves was composed of english, and amy was

scrape, i acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we’ll pull through and have a good time yet. “what put it into your head? did anyone tell you about beth’s giving away her things?” asked laurie soberly, as amy laid a bit of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him. she knew she looked well, she loved to dance, she felt that her foot was on her native heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood. “now, let me see, there’s my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my hat, beth, then my poplin for sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn’t it? the violet silk would be so nice.

taste which i am glad to see. march, hannah, and john caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with two babies instead of one. jo knew that ‘young laurence’ was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls. i’ll give up my place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like. but the ‘up again and take another’ spirit was as strong in jo as in jack, so she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more booty, but nearly left behind her what was far more precious than the moneybags. what

and she won’t miss her as i shall. the fairy queen’s yellow curls reminded her of amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her ‘sorry for it’. “don’t be troubled, meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. ” “he didn’t know that. amy’s lecture put the matter in a new light, and for the first time it did look weak and selfish to lose heart

so happy, dear. allen says, ‘leave out the explanations, make it brief and dramatic, and let the characters tell the story’,” interrupted jo, turning to the publisher’s note. i actually made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, i gave such a gape that she asked me what i meant by opening my mouth wide enough to take the whole book in at once. “where is mother?” asked meg, as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later. ” “ah, we’ll do quantities of good, won’t we? there’s one sort of poverty that i particularly like to help. “don’t you like to dance, miss jo?” asked laurie, looking as if he thought the name suited her. for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister’s faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than jo’s, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. ” “that’s why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners, i suppose. meg’s wedding has turned all our heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities. but having given the rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at a great pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course of romance writing, did not come to the rescue. come amy. he is very decided, but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently. being still too young to go often to the theater, and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. jo followed a minute after to wave her hand to him if he looked round. “yes, i do. holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying breathlessly, “oh, don’t! i didn’t mean to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i couldn’t help flying at you. you can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, if you like. “laurie, i want you to do me a favor, will you?” said meg, as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did very soon though she would not own why. ” “am i an idiot and a brute? how could i think so, when you refused a richer man for me, and won’t let me give you half i want to now, when i have the right? girls do it every day, poor things, and are taught to think it is their only salvation, but you had better lessons, and though i trembled for you at one time, i was not disappointed, for the daughter was true to the mother’s teaching. “yes; we ought to do it, even if we are afraid. ” “you’ll have me for company, if that’s any comfort. at first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their washington correspondence. don’t grieve and fret when i am gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. i’m sure i wish it would, for if i can’t be an

looked childish now, and thoughts of poor john coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. the girls gave their hearts into their mother’s keeping, their souls into their father’s, and to both parents, who lived and labored so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses life and outlives death. i’d given one man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them. t. “i hadn’t time to cook anything. i struggled along as well as i could, but jo was too much for me. that put jo at

in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when she did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them by wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother. , as she put the relics in the rag bag. get me my rubbers, and put these slippers with our things. wouldn’t

for you?” the color deepened in jo’s cheeks as she answered, with the look of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers, “i’m afraid it is so, mother. but jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first. if the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the

palatable viands with which she had provided herself, and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their feelings might not be hurt, a motherly little deception for which they were grateful. “it’s for belle, of course, george always sends her some, but these are altogether ravishing,” cried annie, with a great sniff. next morning fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest pocket, and looked very sentimental. “and i hope aunt march won’t croak. “you like it, mother?” said jo, as they laid down the closely written sheets and looked at one another. ” and meg looked quite contented, as well she might. “there is a demand for whisky, but i think you and i do not care to sell it. how graciously amy criticized the artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for a sequel, which

mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so i conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of herself less, and has decided to try and mold her character as carefully as she

i took no table at all?” “now, my dear, don’t have any ill feeling, i beg. “yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,” replied mrs. this cross was doing much for both father and mother, for one love and sorrow bound them closely together. “don’t do anything rude, pray jo; i won’t have any fuss made, so let it all pass and behave yourself,” begged amy, as she departed early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor little table. “hey! why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?” said the old gentleman, as laurie came running downstairs and brought up with a start of surprise at the astounding sight of jo arm in arm with his redoubtable grandfather. why, it seems only yesterday that i was buttoning amy’s pinafore, and pulling your hair when you
