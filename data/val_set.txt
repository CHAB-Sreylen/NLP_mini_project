every morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown to look out, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone, “oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!” everyone was a friend, and she offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful worshipers. he is so kind to me, i must thank him, and i don’t know any other way. “you

first kiss for marmee!” and turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. then it was that margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious than any luxuries money could buy—in love, protection, peace, and health, the real blessings of life. was the joy all for the boys? then on hearing his destination, she said, “so far away!” in a tone of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like one entirely absorbed in the matter. ” “well, i did it to please amy,” began laurie, with a twinkle that made jo exclaim. beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints out of a paper bag, and an old

flattering, from strangers, were half so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home. “i never ought to, while i have you to cheer me up, marmee, and laurie to take more than half of every burden,” replied amy warmly. beth, who was ready first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened her sisters’ toilets by frequent telegrams from the window. her bonnet wasn’t big enough to hide her face, and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly. feeling this, jo’s burden seemed easier to bear, duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen from the safe

lisbon, she wound up with an earthquake, as a striking and appropriate denouement. i heard mrs. the pale roses amy gave him were the sort that the italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for jo or for himself, but the next instant his american common sense got the better of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh than amy had heard since he came. “can i help you?” said a friendly voice. beth whisked it off, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that made her own eyes fill. not a word did she say, however, till her

says “will you, please?” of course this is all _very private_, but i wished you to know what was going on. “only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn’t go abroad as tutor to some nice person because he wouldn’t leave her. for, as quick to hear her sobbing as she had been to hear her sister’s faintest whisper, her mother came to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater grief than jo’s, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers, because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow. ” chapter three the laurence boy “jo! jo! where are you?” cried meg at the foot of the garret stairs. every shadowy nook, where seats

her as a friend, it was all a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better. so i’ll comfort myself with that, and when i’m ready, i’ll up again and take another. what went on there, meg could not see, but shrieks of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a great flapping of newspapers. if anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy street. with money, talent, position, health, and beauty, ah you like that old vanity! but it’s the truth, so i can’t help saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man you ought to be, you are only. “i too shall go, but i shall gladly come again, if you will gif me leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will keep me here some days. so held, john had waited with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold, and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle with his son than with his whole day’s work. then youth will be delightful, old age will bring few regrets, and

are respectfully solicited. ” “there, beth, that’s an honor to be proud of, i’m sure! laurie told me how fond mr. on christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy. pray forward amy’s as soon as you can spare them. laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the prim old gentleman who came once to woo aunt march, and in the middle of a fine speech, how poll had tweaked his wig off to his great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was the matter. the long table was full, and every one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially, who seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every sense of the word, vanishing as soon as they were done. allow me to present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my seat. “we shouldn’t enjoy ourselves half so

contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. “certainly. when i got back to the nursery there was such an uproar in the parlor that i looked in, and there was mr. “i don’t!” cried jo decidedly. ’ ‘all is sweet, pure, and healthy. “what is it, deary?” asked mrs. i’ve laid in a heap of books, and i’m going to improve my shining hours reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when i’m not having l——” “don’t say ‘larks!’” implored amy, as a return snub for the ‘samphire’ correction. but when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance. now, let’s have a game before it gets hot, and then we’ll see about dinner. march’s arrival, drove straight out to see him. “no, sir. “merry christmas, little daughters! i’m glad you began at once, and hope you will keep on. next day, having seen both the old and young gentleman out of the house, beth, after two or three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and made her way as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol stood. “don’t you love to ride?” asked grace of amy, as they stood resting after a race round the field with the others, led by ned. mrs. then it was that jo, living in the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to see the beauty and the sweetness of beth’s nature, to feel how deep and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the worth of beth’s unselfish ambition to live for others, and make home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth, or beauty. ” “john is so sensible, i’m afraid he will think i’m stupid if i ask questions about politics and things. march put the note in the fire, the money in her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her lips folded tightly in a way which jo would have understood if she had been there. then a family of six or seven boys sprung up like mushrooms, and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as rich, for mr. john. i say, jo, how is grandpa this week? pretty amiable?” “very. ” “hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!” cried polly, tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the ‘rattlepated’ boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech. it also touched her, and she showed that it did, by the cordial tone in which she said. “that devilish professor you were always writing about. ” that had been one of her last ‘trifles’, and john’s eye had fallen on it as he spoke. “try it, honey. 8 or 1. come, laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life. “here

as if it had never occurred to her before. ” frank, beth, amy, and grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight. poetic fire lights up his eye, he struggles ’gainst his lot. don’t laugh

love itself, make the faded faces beautiful in god’s sight. i only wanted a little fun, but this sort doesn’t pay, i find, and i’m getting tired of it. but it will soon grow out again,” said beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep. org. amy felt that there was something behind this, but could not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that she did, “perhaps you had rather i took no table at all?” “now, my dear, don’t have any ill feeling, i beg. aunt woke up and, being more good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what frivolous work i

i can’t take any out. 1. she tries very hard, and i know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. ” jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another. then jo and meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys, set forth the supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was always the crowning joy of the day. how friendly such things make strangers feel, don’t they? she talked away all the time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely. ” chapter forty the valley of the shadow when the first bitterness was over, the family accepted the inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one another by the increased affection which comes to bind households tenderly together in times of trouble. feeling that she must get through the matter somehow, jo produced her manuscript and, blushing redder and redder with each sentence, blundered out fragments of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion. i wish i’d printed the whole or not at all, for i do hate to be so misjudged. brooke,” said kate, with a commanding air, which surprised meg, who treated the tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman. when the sun peeped into the girls’ room early next morning to promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight. i wasn’t meant for a life like this, and i know i shall break away and do something desperate if somebody doesn’t come and help me,” she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when strong wills have to yield to the inevitable. to my dear sister margaret, i give my turkquoise ring (if i get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my piece of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of her ‘little girl’. it’s merely a matter of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place. k. i am often with him, and he enjoys my adventures, while i like to feel that someone is glad to see me when i get back from my wanderings. e. with this idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were badly damaged. then he’s rich and generous and good, and loves us all, and i say it’s a pity my plan is spoiled. “what richness!” sighed jo, sinking into the depth of a velour chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction. it irritated her, but she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console herself by buying something pretty, so that sallie needn’t think she had to economize. “go after them. this is the way we went on. “don’t be alarmed. meg and i would make you laugh over our funny stage properties, and we’d have jolly times. presently beth and amy woke to rummage and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the east grew rosy with the coming day. he was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an honest one, and i was proud to be his friend. ” something in his resolute tone made jo look up quickly to find him looking down at her with an expression that assured her the dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand with an imploring, “no, teddy. while apparently absorbed in her own affairs, jo watched beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled upon one which seemed to explain the change in her. thank you, ladies. cornelius, she racked her brain to remember what hannah did that she left undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that dreadful stuff wouldn’t ‘jell’. there is nothing to eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. ” then she drew her hand over her eyes, for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her handkerchief was, and had just managed to call up a smile when there came a knock at the porch door. hannah was out of humor because her week’s work was deranged, and prophesied that “ef the washin’ and ironin’ warn’t done reg’lar, nothin’ would go well anywheres”. march smoothed the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as meg answered slowly. march had consented to the visit rather reluctantly, fearing that margaret would come back more discontented than she went. march with her usual question, “any letter from father, girls?” and laurie to say in his persuasive way, “won’t some of you come for a drive? i’ve been working away at mathematics till my head is in a muddle, and i’m going to freshen my wits by a brisk turn. there was a momentary lull, broken by hannah, who stalked in, laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again. a dreadful fear passed coldly over jo, as she thought, “beth is dead, and meg is afraid to tell me. jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that laurie was staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes. “what in the world are you doing here?” she asked, regarding her disheveled sister with well-bred surprise. a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them. ” s. march, suiting the action to the word. hang college!” muttered laurie with an impatient sigh. “she could not think it he,” and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped and kissed her. good-by!” as if awaked by the stir, hannah started out of her sleep, hurried to the bed, looked at beth, felt her hands, listened at her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, “the fever’s turned, she’s sleepin’ nat’ral, her skin’s damp, and she breathes easy. poor jo, these were dark days to her, for something like despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures, and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier. we don’t mean to say much about them yet, because we are such very new brooms, but we don’t intend to be idle. mrs. there is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today. i love it dearly, and i’ll come, if you are quite sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed,” she added, fearing to be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke. “are you sure she is safe?” whispered jo, looking remorsefully at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight forever under the treacherous ice. ” the threat sounded awful, but did not alarm jo, for she knew the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary. “and yet your life is very different from the one you pictured so long ago. so they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they should be taken away entirely, instead of increased, and i believe they were never disappointed or sorry that

he will get warm and revive,” said amy hopefully. jo never went back to aunt march, for the old lady took such a fancy to amy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons from one of the best teachers going, and for the sake of this advantage, amy would have served a far harder mistress. the two never quarreled. “yes, please. at seven o’clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom, tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with great solemnity. ” “‘you have done a great deal for your country, sir,’ i said, feeling respect now, instead of pity. ” “is that all?” asked jo, as mrs. she spoke to me at dinner today (for i went to table again, it’s such fun to watch people), and asked me to come and see her at her room. ” “how i wish i was going to college! you don’t look as if you liked it. “i took a last look at my hair while the man got his things, and that was the end of it. “if marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches than we are were never seen,” cried jo, taking a remorseful satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind. he’s been good to father, and you won’t send him away, but let meg marry him, if she wants to. john doesn’t find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. ” “yes, indeed, and there’s another class who can’t ask, and who suffer in silence. “beth and i are going over to kitty bryant’s to get more flowers for tomorrow,” added amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody. if he goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you’ll give in, rather than hurt his feelings. ” and amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit. it was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and spirit in it which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young man’s face as he looked. just then she was both, for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of ‘my friend’ was considered a good joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as he closed the door, completed her discomfiture. jo had never tried this style before, contenting herself with very mild romances for _the spread eagle_. i get so savage, i could hurt anyone and enjoy it. ” “don’t mean to have any. to my friend and neighbor theodore laurence i bequeethe my paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did say it hadn’t any neck. ” but neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom replied in a tone that startled all listeners as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of ferdinand devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the breast where now flashed the star of an english earl was the lovely viola, radiant with joy and beauty. we should have asked you before, only we thought you wouldn’t care for such a girl’s game as this. “now, teddy, i want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,” began jo, as they strolled away together. moffat would wonder at your want of management, if she knew, and how she will rejoice that annie may still hope. “thank you, i will. don’t little boys like little girls?” asked demi, with his mouth full, and an air of bland satisfaction. the unquenchables had done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise. the busy mind has no time to think of sorrow or care or gloom. “i shall never ‘_go_ and marry’ anyone,” observed meg, walking on with great dignity while the others followed, laughing, whispering, skipping stones, and ‘behaving like children’, as meg said to herself, though she might have been tempted to join them if she had not had her best dress on. i never made any plans about what i’d do when i grew up. she had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. ” “don’t go. then the march family turned out en masse, and jo exerted herself to some purpose, for people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring amy’s taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much. beth bouncer will open her new assortment of doll’s millinery next week. “that’s it!” said jo to herself, when she at length discovered that genuine good will toward one’s fellow men could beautify and dignify even a stout german teacher, who shoveled in his dinner, darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of bhaer. “well, then, why didn’t thou tell me all this sooner?” asked jo bashfully. you shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain, and if you catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it’s no more than you deserve. i’ll wear it for fun, and show him i don’t care for the fashion. i love you so much, dear,” added mr. “young ladies, attention, if you please!” at the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue, black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful countenance. “it’s quite enough for the present, as you’ll agree when i tell you where it is. a breath of fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms. ” “i’ll do it with pleasure, mr. sherwood, miss edgeworth, and hannah more, and then produced a tale which might have been more properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral was it. march. au revoir, madamoiselle,” and laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion, which became him better than many men. she did her best, she asked advice of mrs. “i declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown with a maid to wait on me,” said meg, as jo bound up her foot with arnica and brushed her hair. the last name was written in pencil, and amy explained that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly. for a small thing it was a great success, and jo was more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned all at once. “prut! thou beginnest early. it came to her then more bitterly than ever that beth was slowly drifting away from her, and her arms instinctively tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed. i wanted it dreadfully, and wished i was her with all my might. or he’ll get another seat for you, and that isn’t proper when you weren’t asked. bhaer

left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at it. “it is always so quiet and pleasant here, it does me good, meg,” she used to say, looking about her with wistful eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use it in her great house, full of splendid loneliness, for there were no riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and ned lived in a world of his own, where there was no place for her. “i don’t see how you can write and act such splendid things, jo. ” “i wish you wouldn’t. it’s great fun. “jo march, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint! you don’t intend to make calls in that state, i hope,” cried amy, surveying her with amazement. “if god spares beth, i never will complain again,” whispered meg earnestly. i’m sure it’s the least i can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get ready,” said meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes. i’m to carry my share, friedrich, and help to earn the home. read him well, and he will help you much, for the study of character in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it with your pen. he did not say to himself, “it is none of my business. the public bereavement it is our painful duty to record the sudden and mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, mrs. it isn’t like you to be forlorn. “i saw you dancing with the red headed man i ran away from. he said it was dead, and looked at heinrich and minna, who have sore throats. i never tried it before, and hang me if i ever do again!” added john, with an aggrieved air. “i wish i was a horse, then i could run for miles in this splendid air, and not lose my breath. they had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes, and were in the midst of a quiet game of _buzz_, with two or three other young people who had strayed in, when hannah appeared. ” with a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed. having no top to its head, she tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid. the clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, beth put a pair of slippers down to warm. ” “shan’t i disturb you?” “not a bit. i give you leave,” returned laurie, who enjoyed having someone to tease, after his long abstinence from his favorite pastime. the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two. m. ” “suppose you haven’t?” said jo, sewing away, with red eyes, at the new collars which were to be handed over to amy. if it had been anyone else i’d have. the slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with amy’s cologne, the rose was fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect fit. ” but jo got out her desk and began to overhaul her half-finished manuscripts. bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other, but he only said politely, “you haf no umbrella. he fled at once, and the minute it was well, “up with the bonnets of bonnie dundee,” she slipped away to return no more till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon. it was a tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a pocket handkerchief in the front. “i’m glad of that, he is so lonely. ” “i do,” and mrs. she is very proud of him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty was a beautiful thing. books and papers everywhere, a broken meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other. amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely. mr. ” and holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise yet to be fulfilled, jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag bag, and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the roof. she looked round to see how the professor liked it, and found him looking at her with the grimmest expression she had ever seen him wear. “which will you have, beth? there ain’t no need of but one,” aid hannah. come in, and make one of us. go, dear, i forgot that you have any home but this,” and mrs. march looked surprised, but not displeased. she seldom ran—it did not suit her style, she thought, for being tall, the stately and junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante. then she must dust the room, and what a trying job that was. “i had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven’t got over it yet. please add that i send my love to john,” said mrs. “yes, but i don’t know much, except about bread and a few trifles. “you can’t know how hard it is for me to give up meg,” she continued with a little quiver in her voice. “how would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you’re ready to fly out the window or cry?” “it’s naughty to fret, but i do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. he seemed to have thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and taking little tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his arms, he carried her quietly away. won’t that be better than moping here?” “i don’t wish to be sent off as if i was in the way,” began amy, in an injured voice. i’m homely and awkward and odd and old, and you’d be ashamed of me, and we should quarrel—we can’t help it even now, you see—and i shouldn’t like elegant society and you would, and you’d hate my scribbling, and i couldn’t get on without it, and we should be unhappy, and wish we hadn’t done it, and everything would be horrid!” “anything more?” asked laurie, finding it hard to listen patiently to this prophetic burst. laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles, saying slowly, “you’re a sly puss, but i don’t mind being managed by you and beth. i’ve seen the imperial family several times, the emperor an ugly, hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in bad taste, i thought—purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves. ” “i won’t go down till he does. “we’ll put it to a vote,” said the president. ” “you can’t, there is no cure. march went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word of comfort to beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. “i don’t tell tales,” replied laurie, with his ‘high and mighty’ air, as jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore. if aunt march had begged meg to accept john brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn’t think of it, but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind that she would. beth played her gayest march, amy threw open the door, and meg enacted escort with great dignity. how did you make the boys stop calling you dora?” “i thrashed ’em. tell me all about it, and don’t give me wine again, it makes me act so. ” jo’s voice was more pathetic than she knew. moffat’s fibs. the prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which might, after long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this delightful chateau en espagne. i’m going out to dinner and can’t worry about things at home,” said mrs. start: full

that time, hidden away there?” jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they were at home. but the letter telling that beth was failing never reached amy, and when the next found her the grass was green above her sister. now then, meg!” and jo tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do. ” jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her sister, and stored it up to repeat to meg. i fancy he has a hard life of it. “i used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to give the presents, with a kiss. “good evening, apollo!” she answered, smiling back at him, for he too looked unusually debonair, and the thought of entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man caused amy to pity the four plain misses davis from the bottom of her heart. “i saw something i liked this morning, and i meant to tell it at dinner, but i forgot,” said beth, putting jo’s topsy-turvy basket in order as she talked. as the laugh subsided, mrs. “i don’t think i ever ought to call myself ‘unlucky jo’ again, when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified,” said mrs. i came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me skip to think of. i’ll forget all the bad and remember only the good, for i did enjoy a great deal, and thank you very much for letting me go. but someone did come and help her, though jo did not recognize her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity. “when will he come home, marmee?” asked beth, with a little quiver in her voice. ” mrs. although the oldest, jo had the least self-control, and had hard times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting her into trouble. he consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty by the thought that jo’s sister was almost the same as jo’s self, and the conviction that it would have been impossible to love any other woman but amy so soon and so well. that was the name of the little brown house mr. 9. laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly. he hasn’t said anything, but he looks a great deal. ” and away he went, in a great hurry. then tea must be got, errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until the last minute. laurie’s a nice boy and i like him, and i won’t have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such rubbish. ” esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in their anxiety. “i need it so much. it’s no exertion to me, but you don’t look equal to it. ” “mayn’t i hope you’ll change your mind by-and-by? i’ll wait and say nothing till you have had more time. esther fitted up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it, and over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms. jo knew that ‘young laurence’ was regarded as a most eligible parti by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their daughters, and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed to find that he still believed in modest girls. he was not ashamed of it, but put it away as one of the bitter-sweet experiences of his life, for which he could be grateful when the pain was over. ” “let me mend them,” said i. the knight wished intensely that he could free them, but he was poor and could only go by each day, watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in the sunshine. “hush! don’t say anything,” she whispered, adding aloud, “it’s nothing. march, sitting down by meg, yet keeping hold of jo, lest she should fly off. there were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture or two, a stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the fairer for the loving messages they brought. davis had evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning, there was an east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils had not done him the credit which he felt he deserved. ” and jo gave her a slight shake. you must get well. hearing the lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much that i took a fancy to learn, for tina runs in and out, leaving the door open, and i can hear. for the touch of grief will render my wild nature more serene, give to life new aspirations, a new trust in the unseen. “who knows? stranger things have happened,” thought jo, as she fussed about the room. we’ve more of this sort of thing on hand than we know what to do with at present, but i’ll run my eye over it, and give you an answer next week. “she rides splendidly. she longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and be kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she did nothing of the sort, and when she saw john coming, began to hum quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in her best parlor. “yes, truly. ” there jo stopped and turned scarlet with a sudden thought. in fact, i rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing you a favor all the while. ” “make it so pleasant he won’t want to go away. ” “you are going, then?” “i haf no longer any business here, it is done. ” then the professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that laurie thought him the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met. what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose! i don’t envy her much, in spite of her money, for after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, i think,” added jo. “do as he tells you. “a fellow can’t live on books,” said laurie, shaking his head as he perched on a table opposite. ” the boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till jo said, trying to be polite and easy, “i think i’ve had the pleasure of seeing you before. everybody dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found energy enough even to take up their worsted work. “i can’t do it. to her mother’s inquiries she answered that she was quite well, and jo’s she silenced by begging to be let alone. ” “i’m a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but i’m willing to own that you are right, only it’s easier for me to risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when i don’t feel like it. wouldn’t some of your girls like to run over, and practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know, ma’am?” beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly together to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid instrument quite took her breath away. of course there was a general stampede, and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for the strangest things were done, and no one said a word. “what’s the last joke? undo the bundle and see, meg,” said beth, eying the knobby parcel with curiosity. when that is off we shall see how he regards the fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her stern father bestows her hand,” returned the troubadour. oh, when these hidden stores of ours lie open to the father’s sight, may they be rich in golden hours, deeds that show fairer for the light, lives whose brave music long shall ring, like a spirit-stirring strain, souls that shall gladly soar and sing in the long sunshine after rain. i, too, have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of your resolution, since it begins to bear fruit. ” said jo, trying to speak cheerfully. we invited him to our party, but he didn’t come. so brilliant and gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first snow. zara replied and, after a musical dialogue, consented to fly. i want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today,” and meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her with april faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed the old. i’m so tired i can’t stir. just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so the ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the last fashion. i wish we could wash from our hearts and souls the stains of the week away, and let water and air by their magic make ourselves as pure as they. “you say often you wish a library. next morning, instead of the usual call, amy received a note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end. ” mrs. i had been sitting near this door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as i am. oh, let me do something!” cried the boy, hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see. ” “mother doesn’t approve of flirting even in fun, and you do flirt desperately, teddy. of course it was uphill work at first, and jo made queer mistakes, but the wise professor steered her safely into calmer waters, and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end. ” but she didn’t finish, for he looked so friendly that she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost the little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed him. i don’t believe you’ve got any heart. she valued his esteem, she coveted his respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship, and just when the wish was sincerest, she came near to losing everything. when he offered her his arm, she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but when he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply that despair fell upon him. he is handsome, young, clever enough, and very rich—ever so much richer than the laurences. ” ah, jo, instead of wishing that, thank god that ‘father and mother were particular’, and pity from your heart those who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth, but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon in womanhood. we can run down there any time, and it’s really a pity to trail through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are tired and cross. i thought you hated to be tied to a woman’s apron string?” retorted jo, quoting certain rebellious words of his own. ” i laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic, also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes. other models failing her for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, i don’t care for it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn’t like to refuse, you see. “i telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and brooke answered she’d come at once, and she’ll be here tonight, and everything will be all right. she would not ask him to stay at home, but felt injured because he did not know that she wanted him without being told, entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited for her in vain. all day she haunted the room, jealous of any other nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life ever brought her. march, with placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had gone. the cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman was deaf, and esther the only one who ever took any notice of the young lady. meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again, and exposed the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, “more sudar, marmar. she was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, “i’m sure now that i shouldn’t be afraid of him, for he’s got kind eyes, though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will of his own. “gloves are more important than anything else. march knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna. father’s best books found their way there, mother’s easy chair, jo’s desk, amy’s finest sketches, and every day meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine for aunty beth. jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable. but she begged so hard, and sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life. may i speak quite freely, and will you remember that it’s mother who blames as well as mother who sympathizes?” “indeed i will! speak to me as if i were little meg again. then suddenly he tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the last fluttered out of his hand, he said soberly to himself. “because if you care much about riches, you will never go and marry a poor man,” said jo, frowning at laurie, who was mutely warning her to mind what she said. i felt delicate about taking any, as i couldn’t return them, and i’m actually suffering for one. they won’t understand the joke, and it will worry mother. march. if the laurences had been what jo called ‘prim and poky’, she would not have got on at all, for such people always made her shy and awkward. but i am afraid i don’t,” and meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted. if john had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would have been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly. i’ve tried and failed, and i won’t risk our happiness by such a serious experiment. “the laurence boy’s grandfather! what in the world put such a thing into his head? we don’t know him!” exclaimed meg. e. you do try to fight off your shyness, and i love you for it. ” john never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing so, and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be a bonnet, and cost six dollars. “i’ll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan’t drag it out of me, so you’ll forgive me, meg, and i’ll do anything to show how out-and-out sorry i am,” he added, looking very much ashamed of himself. “i don’t. when they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies, and go laughing away, to smoke and drink beer, i suppose. i arranged them myself, remembering that you didn’t like what hannah calls a ‘sot-bookay’,” said laurie, handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she had long coveted as she daily passed it in cardiglia’s window. i enjoyed it very much, and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me. laurie’s bashfulness soon wore off, for jo’s gentlemanly demeanor amused and set him at his ease, and jo was her merry self again, because her dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her. then she tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how earnest her work had been. he does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all, and i try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits. everyone greeted him kindly, for jo’s sake at first, but very soon they liked him for his own. this new order of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for ‘marmar’, as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat. e. all day jo and meg hovered over her, watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in god and mother, and all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours dragged slowly by. that comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,” said jo, trying to soothe beth, who trembled and looked more excited than she had ever been before. it isn’t proper to be gadding about so late with a rattlepated boy like. now, isn’t it a dreadful state of things?” “do you think meg cares for him?” asked mrs. g. he received no stars or bars, but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life and love are very precious when both are in full bloom. “no, it was me. grief is the best opener of some hearts, and jo’s was nearly ready for the bag. “we shall never know any peace till that child learns to go to bed properly. ever your amy chapter thirty-two tender troubles “jo, i’m anxious about beth. what is it, dear?” “shall i go away?” asked jo discreetly. oh, me! it does seem as if all the troubles came in a heap, and i got the heaviest part on my shoulders,” sighed jo, spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry. “she’s proud, but i don’t believe she’d mind, for that dowdy tarlaton is all she has got. “it isn’t a mere pleasure trip to me, girls,” she said impressively, as she scraped her best palette. ” “now, marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!” cried meg. demi, like a true yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting to know everything, and often getting much disturbed because he could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual “what for?” he also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of his grandfather, who used to hold socratic conversations with him, in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk. she called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and said i was a credit to her, and she’d like to keep me always. jo wouldn’t be put into the opera at any price, and he had to give her up with a “bless that girl, what a torment she is!” and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted composer. “my lady,” as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks. ” as jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family went off into a gale of merriment, and mr. s. but the ‘up again and take another’ spirit was as strong in jo as in
