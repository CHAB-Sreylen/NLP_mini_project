she ‘make the house cheerful’ when all its light and warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when beth left the old home for the new, and where in all the world could she ‘find some useful, happy work to do’, that would take the place of the loving service which had been its own reward? she tried in a blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and harder as she toiled along. “of course not. thank you all, heaps and heaps! speaking of books

in ‘our best society’, without being quite sure what the best really was. then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. for a fortnight, the professor came and went with lover-like regularity. jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction, and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge that she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny. laurence. her keen eyes filled, and when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so. her readers were not particular about such trifles as grammar, punctuation, and probability, and mr. “well, dear, what is the ‘dem’d total’, as mr. i’ve gone blindly on, hurting myself and other people, for the sake of money. well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for it, likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than she expected that she was thrown

burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking friend might be. perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. but as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks, he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed in perfection. it was a

infants with the air of a big, benevolent newfoundland looking at a pair of infantile kittens. my dear, he’s longing for his little home, but it isn’t home without you, and you are always in the nursery. everything was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance into her various closets, bags, and boxes, jo decided that amy had forgiven and forgotten her wrongs. jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave quiet look which best became her, and laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his chin on a level with her curly head, smiled with his friendliest aspect, and nodded at her

several of jo’s letters, and in another compartment were three notes from amy, carefully tied up with one of her blue ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put away inside. “not a

performance, jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction, amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, “well, i do believe the world is coming to an end. ” as amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the sleeping child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow over amy’s sunshine. hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff. but when our first little passion has been crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making a second trial, so laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour, and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance. ” and demi retired to his mother’s skirts for protection. davis was quite benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous. s. as goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song, so laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to compose a requiem which should harrow up jo’s soul and melt the heart of every hearer. “me loves evvybody,” she once said, opening her arms, with her spoon in one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to embrace and nourish the whole world. i’ll do anything if you’ll let me stop a bit, for it’s as dull as the desert of sahara down there. what put it into your head, little mother?” “well, i had a talk with marmee the other day, and told her how nervous and cross and out of sorts i felt, and she said i needed change and less care, so hannah is to help me with the children, and i’m to see to things about the house more, and now and then have a little fun, just to keep me from getting to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before my time. weekly report meg—good. “why?” asked meg, looking surprised. but even the satisfaction of talking with a distant connection of the british nobility did not render amy forgetful of time, and when the proper number of minutes had passed, she reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked about for jo, fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of march. upon my word i will!” and laurie meant what he said. it was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first trying-on, and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm july day. “don’t let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than mosquitoes,” whispered the old lady to amy, as the rooms filled and laurie’s black head towered above the rest. it’s a great mistake for young girls like meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and gossip. “where’s your secret? play fair, teddy, or i’ll never believe you again,” she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that blazed up at a word of encouragement. letters, manuscripts,

her heart ached to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while beth learned to say goodbye to health, love, and life, and take up her cross so cheerfully. away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced at home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round, feeling more friendly than ever

seldom failed to bring him out to see—well, he always asked for mr. when she met him she looked surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that she had come for that express purpose. he said the change was owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits. “i can’t stand this,” muttered the old gentleman. and when the snowy afternoon came, jo resolved to try what could be done. ” “that won’t last long. “no. “i wouldn’t tell anyone except you, mother, but i really do need advice, for if john goes on much longer i might as well be widowed,” replied mrs. with hearty thanks and best wishes, i remain “‘your grateful friend and humble servant, ‘james laurence’. “hush! he’ll hear. even polly seemed

cheerful words. this obliging offer was gladly accepted, and margaret retired to the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the

and i am going to valrosa to sketch, will you come?” said amy, as she joined laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual, about noon. believe this heartily, and go to god with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as freely and confidingly as you come to your mother. the fever flush and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a standing joke. if amy is bothering, i’ll shake her. “no, i didn’t. “where’s laurie?” she asked presently, when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done. “may i come again?” asked laurie. jo drew a long breath and unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart. “you mean the people who live in the big house next door, don’t you?” asked one of the girls. they always looked back before turning the corner, for their mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and wave her hand to them. he seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, “will you try and find out? i want to know so much, for i can’t go to work with any heart until i learn whether i am to have my reward in the end or not. yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson. john doesn’t find me interesting any longer, so he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor, who has no incumbrances. meg hardly knew herself, she felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend john and assert her right to love him, if she liked. he likes to write, and he’ll give a tone to our contributions and keep us from being sentimental, don’t you see? we can do so little for him, and he does so much for us, i think the least we can do is to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes. this isn’t like beth, and it worries me. ” jo couldn’t help smiling at the important air which meg had unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty color varying in her cheeks. hither, hither, from thy home, airy sprite, i bid thee come! born of roses, fed on dew, charms and potions canst thou brew? bring me here, with elfin speed, the fragrant philter which i need. hospital stores are not always good. all three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood. laurie had christened it, saying it was highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who ‘went on together like a pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo’. bowing with the air of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern and ordered hagar to come forth with a commanding, “what ho, minion! i need thee!” out came meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face, a red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her cloak. ’” “hum, that’s stiff and cool enough! i don’t believe you’ll ever say it, and i know he won’t be satisfied if you do. oh, won’t she lecture though!” said jo, as she sipped with returning spirit. brooke came for his umbrella,” began meg, wishing that mr. “i don’t think secrets agree with me, i feel rumpled up in my mind since you told me that,” said jo rather ungratefully. “amy, you’ve got it!” “no, i haven’t. in vain amy telegraphed the word ‘talk’, tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. he got interested in spite of himself, and before he knew it, was drawn into the circle. everyone thought soberly for a minute, then meg announced, as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, “i shall give her a nice pair of gloves. “here’s a note to you, meg, all sealed up. amy was sketching a group of ferns, and jo was knitting as she read aloud. ” “oh, mother! she’s too young, it’s my turn first. but she begged so hard, and sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life. i like your grateful spirit, my dear. “your hand, miss march!” was the only answer her mute appeal received, and too proud to cry or beseech, amy set her teeth, threw back her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling blows on her little palm. “marmee, i want to ‘fess’. march. i’ll see what these little girls can do for him,” thought mr. the curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. to wit:—namely to my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works of art, including frames. a bitter sense of wrong and the thought of jenny snow helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces, and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it hard to study with that pathetic figure before them. if you are outside the united states, check the laws of your country in addition to the

chosen, too, for in a week she weds count antonio, whom she passionately hates. chapter twenty confidential i don’t think i have any words in which to tell the meeting of the mother and daughters. he found nothing to perplex or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something in dress and bearing which we call elegance. laurence went home to rest. ” “i’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said beth, “let’s each get her something for christmas, and not get anything for ourselves. march, looking at the plump little hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger, and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped together. i had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner, and i’m going to the other, who is very sick in a washington hospital. “how absurd of you! the girls dressed me up for fun, and i rather like it. in his love of jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through college, was a much of a boy as ever. poor old fellow! i’ve been through it all, and i can sympathize. march, as the sisters went daintily down the walk. she is so funny and dear as she is,” said beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at jo’s having secrets with anyone but her. “it shall be as you please, mrs. now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly, renounced the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified bonnet, with tracts in her pocket. but i’d rather do it myself. then out in the free fresh air they swing, under the sunny sky. now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday’s mud still adorned the steps. now, dear, good-by. now aunt march possessed in perfection the art of rousing the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed doing it. she lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it with salt and butter, for dinner. he didn’t come, and just at night i remembered what you said when amy fell into the river. gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard, but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them, and does not deceive anybody a particle. “no, but i’ll save you some little cakies for breakfast, if you’ll go bye-bye like daisy. if ‘genius is eternal patience’, as michelangelo affirms, amy had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called ‘high art’. a crash, a cry, and a laugh from laurie, accompanied by the indecorous exclamation, “jupiter ammon! jo’s upset the cake again!” caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived, and ‘the party came in’, as beth used to say when a child. “how dare you say so, when he’s got both his eyes? and very handsome ones they are, too,” cried jo, who resented any slighting remarks about her friend. neither of them had forgotten camp laurence, or the fun we had there. i want to fly away at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate. “no, you didn’t, and you’ll say so in the end, for it did you good, and proved that you could do something if you tried. ” “and don’t say funny things when we ought to be sober. jo took him at his word, for she coolly turned round and studied him—a proceeding which would have much surprised him, had he known it, for the worthy professor was very humble in his own conceit. beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls. “good girl! call meg, and tell her you’ll give in,” said laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed amy more than the ‘giving in’. at the kings’ she daily saw all she wanted, for the children’s older sisters were just out, and meg caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets, heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties, and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished on trifles which would have been so precious to her. he shook his head and beckoned her to come away, but she was fascinated just then by the freedom of speculative philosophy, and kept her seat, trying to find out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after they had annihilated all the old beliefs. if she had, i should have felt as if i ought to do it, but plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and i’d rather be excused. i can’t, but it’s very nice to see you, and i’m so glad aunt march gave you that lovely one. “run, beth, and help hannah clear half the things off the table. now, could she do it? she decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she found the helps i have suggested. “i’m not sorry,” protested jo, with a choke. s. isn’t it fun? are they boys? what are you going to name them? let’s have another look. but he exulted in private and longed for the time to come when he could give jo a piece of plate, with a bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms. just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. 4. weller deposited a little key on the table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and it was some time before order could be restored. but you must help me, remind me, and keep me from flying out. that satisfied amy, and when she got home she found the vases paraded on the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each. i’ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and i’ll try it off. other helps had jo—humble, wholesome duties and delights that would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly learned to see and value. “i merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations between adjoining nations, i have set up a post office in the hedge in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the females, if i may be allowed the expression. moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward. ” “and you expect to live on the produce of the place? well, that sounds paradisiacal, but you’ll find it desperate hard work. she is going in the spring when the opera comes, and it will be perfectly splendid, if mother only lets me go,” answered meg, cheering up at the thought. ” “i will, dear, i will, and if anything happens, i’ll come and comfort you,” whispered laurie, little dreaming that he would be called upon to keep his word. she seldom ran—it did not suit her style, she thought, for being tall, the stately and junoesque was more appropriate than the sportive or piquante. ha. her ‘scribbling suit’ consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a cheerful red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks were cleared for action. ” “‘not a mite more than i ought, ma’am. “miss eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, i thought,” observed beth, with unusual warmth. it’s a splendid idea. when the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath, and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students’ festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister. march’s warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes later laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if for his life. “you impertinent boy! of course i’m not,” exclaimed sallie, with an air that proved the contrary. “it is not for me, i must not hope it now,” he said to himself, with a sigh that was almost a groan. “no. she never had much to show when she came home, but was studying nature, i dare say, while she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the terrace at valrosa, or absently sketched any fancy that occurred to her, a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a young man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a curly haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ballroom on the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not altogether satisfactory. when do you begin your great work of art, raphaella?” he asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it. ” “i won’t go down till he does. he stood so still that a squirrel, busy with its harvesting, ran down a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that beth looked up, espied the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring smile. “i haven’t got any,” said meg forlornly. “yes, truly. “why, where is amy’s bottle of cologne?” she added, as the little flask did not appear. i felt as if i’d got into a romance, sitting there, watching the neckar rolling through the valley, listening to the music of the austrian band below, and waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl. your letter came in the morning, but you said nothing about a parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so i was disappointed, for i’d had a ‘kind of feeling’ that you wouldn’t forget me. nice thing, isn’t it?” and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears. we are pining for a visit. i’m not good for much, i know, but i’ll stand by you, jo, all the days of my life. i’m afraid to go alone, do come and take care of me. mrs. amy, tell hannah to get down the black trunk, and meg, come and help me find my things, for i’m half bewildered. everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair opened, then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices, try to work together. ned moffat had just married sallie gardiner, and meg couldn’t help contrasting their fine house and carriage, many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing she could have the same. she never thought of a will. do you know truth?” “i hope so,” said meg soberly. “the lord keep the dear man! i won’t waste no time a-cryin’, but git your things ready right away, mum,” she said heartily, as she wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women in one. i quite long to see the dear man,” added mrs. “the joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and i rather think the changes have begun,” said mrs. why?” “because if you are, i’ll take a bus. the song was considered a great success, and the singer retired covered with laurels. after many serious discussions with meg and jo, the pattern was chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun. “there is truth in it, jo, that’s the secret. it certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. “you wicked, wicked girl! i never can write it again, and i’ll never forgive you as long as i live. ” “don’t know any. at three, daisy demanded a ‘needler’, and actually made a bag with four stitches in it. bhaer, managing to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles, “jo, i haf nothing but much love to gif you. not being a dog in the manger, but the happiest fellow alive, i assure you i can dance at jo’s wedding with a heart as light as my heels. then the eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding an explanation. ” “bless you, i don’t spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is gone before i know it. that is the secret of our home happiness. ” meg spoke seriously and expected to see laurie frown or laugh, but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous way, “i like that! for i’ve seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do. ” “that sounds well. laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. it’s you and meg and brooke who make it all go, and i’m no end obliged to you. he had plenty of money, but didn’t know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran away, and forged his father’s name, i believe, and was altogether horrid. ” now, that was hard. promise me that, laurie. dashwood gave jo a quick look, which seemed to take note of everything she had on, from the bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots. dear little girl! she’s so ambitious, but her heart is good and tender, and no matter how high she flies, she never will forget home. it was hard to say. ” “well, i won’t for the present, anyway, but i’m disgusted, and wish you hadn’t told me. then came the grand effect of the play. go, brave heart, and save me from despair. but that evening jo fancied that beth’s eyes rested on the lively, dark face beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match, though the phrases, ‘caught off a tice’, ‘stumped off his ground’, and ‘the leg hit for three’, were as intelligible to her as sanskrit. i earned it, and i don’t think you’ll blame me, for i only sold what was my own. a fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and i took a fancy to my den on the spot. i caught her singing that song he gave her, and once she said ‘john’, as you do, and then turned as red as a poppy. let them hear how much you have improved,” said laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil. “please, tell the young ladies what i say, and if they don’t care to come, why, never mind. hagar, the witch, chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads, with weird effect. ” “make it so pleasant he won’t want to go away. but amy had not forgotten miss snow’s cutting remarks about ‘some persons whose noses were not too flat to smell other people’s limes, and stuck-up people who were not too proud to ask for them’, and she instantly crushed ‘that snow girl’s’ hopes by the withering telegram, “you needn’t be so polite all of a sudden, for you won’t get any. “it’s quite enough for the present, as you’ll agree when i tell you where it is. now please take the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company. ” she did not finish her speech, for belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly. “this is mamma’s friend, miss march. “never mind what she says. ” chapter twenty-eight domestic experiences like most other young matrons, meg began her married life with the determination to be a model housekeeper. we don’t say much, but we see it, and the lord will bless you for’t, see ef he don’t. my pretty, tender hearted girl! i hope things will go happily with her. just think, he’s given you her piano. “my faithful friend and noble patron,” continued laurie with a wave of the hand, “who has so flatteringly presented me, is not to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight. on learning his good fortune she almost clapped her hands. i don’t care much for company dancing. the nursery, where i am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next mrs. jo had never tried this style before, contenting herself with very mild romances for _the spread eagle_. sallie moffat renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house, or inviting ‘that poor dear’ to come in and spend the day at the big house. the invalids improved rapidly, and mr. this maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite. dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but promised to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word. presently jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of the stile, “laurie, i want to tell you something. meanwhile she lay on her bed with old joanna at her side, for even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege. “time will show. it will make fun, and i don’t mind being a guy if i’m comfortable. good night, doctor jo. pere la chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are like small rooms, and looking in, one sees a table, with images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners to sit in when they come to lament. “it’s a fast age, and i don’t know what we are coming to, ma’am. ” which was not quite a correct statement, by the way. she only saw his chest rise and fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and the hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of. it’s for the freedmen as well as the chesters, and i think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. ” a quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine. “stop jabbering, girls, and i’ll tell you everything,” said jo, wondering if miss burney felt any grander over her evelina than she did over her ‘rival painters’. the girls couldn’t help laughing, and felt better for it, though meg shook her head at the young lady

downstairs. tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two boats pushed off together, leaving mr. ” and having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply, jo slipped out of the room to give meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. the young lady herself received the news as tidings of great joy, went about in a solemn sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and pack her pencils that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes, money, and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art than herself. this household happiness did not come all at once, but john and meg had found the key to it, and each year of married life taught them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries of real home love and mutual helpfulness, which the poorest may possess, and the richest cannot buy. ” “what did you say to him?” asked mrs. but it’s no use to ask such a crosspatch to take me. i poked it out, and it ran under the bookcase. how many did you have out?” jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then began to laugh as if mightily amused at something. at vevay, laurie was never idle, but always walking, riding, boating, or studying in the most energetic manner, while amy admired everything he did and followed his example as far and as fast as she could. i can’t sing ‘land of the leal’ now, it makes me cry. i give you entire liberty, but i trust you to make an honest use of it. “aye! aye! aye!” replied three voices at once. at nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual,
