mother will accept, i’m sure, and it will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of her. ” “i thought so. the great door flew open, and he beheld. “mercy me! i don’t know anything about love and such nonsense!” cried jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt. ” “i know it cannot, and i don’t fear it any longer, for i’m sure i shall be your beth still, to love and help you more than ever. it was a people’s course, the lecture on the pyramids, and jo rather wondered at the choice of such a subject for such an audience, but took it for granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great want supplied by unfolding the glories of the pharaohs to an audience whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour, and whose lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the sphinx. i enjoyed the trips to hampton court and the kensington museum more than anything else, for at hampton i saw raphael’s cartoons, and at the museum, rooms full of pictures by turner, lawrence, reynolds, hogarth, and the other great creatures. “here’s a sweet prospect!” muttered jo, slamming the stove door open, and poking vigorously among the cinders. laurence. laurie was her especial dread, but thanks to the new manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called mr. he does know how to manage them, and will be a great help, for demi is getting too much for me. nobody knew where the evening went to, for hannah skillfully abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy poppies, and mr. many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the irs. ” “no, indeed! it’s past nine, and dark as egypt. he had no thought of a melodramatic plunge, but some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat, and row away with all his might, making better time up the river than he had done in any race. “where is mother?” asked meg, as she and jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later. “you have all done more for me than i can ever thank you for, except by doing my best not to disappoint you. has made her plans,” “that fib about her mamma,” and “dowdy tarlaton,” till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully, “i’ll let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he needs me, for i am all he has. “thou shouldst save some for the little friend. ” and amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it. ” “oh, dear!” sighed amy, “now she’s in a contrary fit, and will drive me distracted before i can get her properly ready. ” a restless movement from laurie suggested that his chair was not easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the old man add hastily, “i don’t mean to be a marplot or a burden. and speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the ‘dovecote’. ” and jo took heart again, for that salutation could not be called lover-like. ” “he didn’t know that. poor dear, just wait till i make my fortune, and you shall revel in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers, and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with. i’ve friends in london and paris, and should like to visit them. the view is so lovely, and i like to feed the peacocks. poor jo blushed till she couldn’t blush any redder, and her heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had said. ” “let me show you. one of the girls kept laughing affectedly, and saying, “now professor,” in a coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her german with an accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober. i’ve seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants, and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house, lovely grounds, and fine horses. then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving views reflected in the lake. ‘your geese will tell you, they know everything. “i hate to borrow as much as mother does, and i knew aunt march would croak, she always does, if you ask for a ninepence. mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer his prejudices, but papa believed that it never was too soon to learn obedience. you have rather cast me off lately, jo, but i’ve had the best of help, nevertheless. ” “thank you. amy did not come, meg went to her room to try on a new dress, jo was absorbed in her story, and hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. ” “we will, marmee, we will!” cried both, with all their hearts, as she bade them good night. feeling indignant that he was not taken into his tutor’s confidence, he set his wits to work to devise some proper retaliation for the slight. she told her story, expecting to be consoled, but laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. ’ “ah! but i haf an eye, and i see much. meg this note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed letters. i’ve calculated the cost, and i’ll pay for it myself. “it is only another name for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though we do want to be good, it’s hard work and we forget, and don’t do our best. amy said, “everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn’t settle down, which was queer, since father was safe at home,” and beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn’t run over as usual. ” “then why did you do it?” said laurie’s eyes, so plainly that meg hastily added. ” but she did show something better than brilliancy or skill, for she sang beth’s songs with a tender music in her voice which the best master could not have taught, and touched the listener’s hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have given her. “‘i have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but i never had any that suited me so well as yours,’” continues jo. ’. miss kate took out her sketch again, and margaret watched her, while mr. but young as she was, jo had learned that hearts, like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must open naturally, so though she believed she knew the cause of beth’s new pain, she only said, in her tenderest tone, “does anything trouble you, deary?” “yes, jo,” after a long pause. “his grandpa does not know what’s good for him, and keeps him shut up all alone. ” “i can’t help it. so jo was satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work with a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks. ” all eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a murmur of amazement went through the throng, for neither bride nor groom removed their masks. “no, thank you. ” this artful allusion to benefits conferred brought tupman to his feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind. seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, laurie threw himself down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower step of the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face. ” “you’ll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you away. “i won’t be so silly, or hurt marmee’s feelings, when she took so much pains to get my things. ” “ach, mein gott, that is so good!” cried mr. “it isn’t anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show it. on the way get these things. shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched newspapers for accidents, incidents, and crimes. it will be a great help to have cool, impartial persons take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it. then, to complicate the ruin, she cut it down one third, and confidingly sent the poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into the big, busy world to try its fate. i suppose it’s natural to some people to please without trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the wrong place. i wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up. “rather. mr. so the year rolled round, and at midsummer there came to meg a new experience, the deepest and tenderest of a woman’s life. suddenly some one passed below, whistling like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, “all serene! coming in tonight. malaprop, and sailed in with a mask on. it was a pictorial sheet, and jo examined the work of art nearest her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances needed the melodramatic illustration of an indian in full war costume, tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes, were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying away in the background with her mouth wide open. all began bravely, but broke down one by one till beth was left alone, singing with all her heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler. in america, as everyone knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence, and enjoy their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a seclusion almost as close as a french nunnery, though by no means as quiet. ned’s assurances that he came especially to see her. “if we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something, perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because we don’t approve of them, and smile upon another set because we do, wouldn’t have a particle of effect, and we should only be considered odd and puritanical. there is no need of that. and p. we can’t tell him so, but he won’t do it again, take my word for it. laurence’s gruff voice sounded gruffer than ever, as jo tapped at his door. march, returning the look with a keen one. beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once, and amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for katy brown’s party was to be the next day and now like flora mcflimsey, she had ‘nothing to wear’. i shall keep a journal-letter, and send it once a week, so goodnight, and more tomorrow. i witnessed her will, and it is to be so,” whispered esther smiling. i’ll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a satisfaction to my friends. one thing disturbed her satisfaction, and that was that she did not tell them at home. bhaer. i’m very well, and mean to do great things next winter, so that i may be ready for rome, whenever that joyful time arrives. ” “it’s no harm, jo. he was possessed with a mania for patronizing yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth. things were in this state when the grand discovery was made, and jo watched laurie that night as she had never done before. march decidedly. in vain mrs. he might just as well have turned a somersault and uttered an indian war whoop, for his face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said, in a queer, breathless voice, “here’s another christmas present for the march family. dashwood was not too deeply absorbed in a cigar to remember his manners, so the second interview was much more comfortable than the first. “what a dreadful day this has been!” began jo, usually the first to speak. ” jo liked that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but the boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled with her pleasure. both tone and shadow struck amy, for she had seen and heard them before, and now she looked up in time to catch a new expression on laurie’s face—a hard bitter look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and regret. ” “that is the prettiest wedding i’ve been to for an age, ned, and i don’t see why, for there wasn’t a bit of style about it,” observed mrs. pickwick why is the p. “tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as i know to my sorrow. mr. she did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she made no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done. stop a bit. i shall miss my boy, but i shall love the man as much, and admire him more, because he means to be what i hoped he would. as that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. it was bitter cold in the morning, she dropped her precious turnover in the gutter, aunt march had an attack of the fidgets, meg was sensitive, beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home, and amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking about being good and yet wouldn’t even try when other people set them a virtuous example. she felt her exile deeply, and for the first time in her life, realized how much she was beloved and petted at home. one of the young ladies asked jo where she got the pretty drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid jo, instead of mentioning the place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer with unnecessary frankness, “oh, amy painted it. ” “how is the lovely miss randal?” asked amy with a significant smile. kirke’s private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty children, rather spoiled, i fancy, but they took to me after telling them the seven bad pigs, and i’ve no doubt i shall make a model governess. the invalids improved rapidly, and mr. ” and so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, jo had whisked things into place and given quite a different air to the room. my beth! the dust is always swept from the lid that bears your name, as if by loving eyes that wept, by careful hands that often came. mr. ” “no, mother, it is better as it is, and i’m glad amy has learned to love him. upon my word, i was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that i didn’t know which i loved best, you or amy, and tried to love you both alike. in a postscript she desired him not to tell amy that beth was worse, she was coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening the remainder of her stay. o my sister, passing from me, out of human care and strife, leave me, as a gift, those virtues which have beautified your life. ” “well, she does it so imperceptibly that i don’t think i shall mind much. queens of society can’t get on without money, so you mean to make a good match, and start in that way? quite right and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the lips of one of your mother’s girls. there was not much time for preparation, and the house was in a ferment till amy was off. “we wanted to surprise you. at the back of his chair she stopped and stood listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red with excitement of this unusual performance. it flew open, and there he stood in his dressing gown, with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle in the other. do you?” “not often. if i get your grandpa to apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?” asked jo seriously. “no, winking isn’t ladylike. think over mother’s preachment, act upon it if it seems good, and god bless you all. i never thought of anything but a traveling friendship till the serenade night. a pleasant winter to you, and may the gods grant you a blissful honeymoon at valrosa! i think fred would be benefited by a rouser. there’s laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy! oh, mercy me! here’s a carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl, and two dreadful boys. that music has taken the vanity out of me as rome took it out of her, and i won’t be a humbug any longer. he says he won’t come down till he has one, and talks about washington, and goes on in an absurd way. now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday’s mud still adorned the steps. i must say, i like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a blarnerying beggar. having copied her novel for the fourth time, read it to all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts which she particularly admired. my partners do almost everything, i’m merely holding on until you take my place, and can be off at any time. i knew it by the names and the initials, and in it there was one little verse that seemed to call me. “there’s mother. don’t i always tell you everything? i was ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but i want you to know all the dreadful things i did at the moffats’. “oh dear, we are growing up with a vengeance. ” jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities, and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business. her face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers, i can’t help watching it. ” laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace as she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took the reins himself, and left little baptiste nothing to do but fold his arms and fall asleep on his perch. “i shall take the cream and the muffings,” added amy, heroically giving up the article she most liked. the great novelist vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum; the famous divine flirted openly with one of the madame de staels of the age, who looked daggers at another corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed tea johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the lady rendering speech impossible. kiss dear father on the cheek he calls mine. she sent loving messages to amy, bade them tell her mother that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to try to say a word, that father might not think she had neglected him. “glad to find you so merry, my girls,” said a cheery voice at the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly lady with a ‘can i help you’ look about her which was truly delightful. in the autumn, new trials and experiences came to meg. let’s do it, jo. ” “i look as if i needed it, don’t i?” said laurie, getting up and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing to the rapturous, as amy’s voice was heard calling, “where is she? where’s my dear old jo?” in trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers were set down to be looked at and exulted over. oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly! and was so touched and pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his own little granddaughter back again. hannah is a model servant, and guards pretty meg like a dragon. they shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening, for annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them. i’m not aristocratic, but i do object to being seen with a person who looks like a young prize fighter,” observed jo severely. dashwood graciously permitted her to fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it necessary to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had basely left him in the lurch. “you’re a perfect cherub! now put on all your best things, and i’ll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will make a good impression. say nothing to madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a while to think good thoughts, and pray the dear god preserve your sister. ’, for as secret societies were the fashion, it was thought proper to have one, and as all of the girls admired dickens, they called themselves the pickwick club. all were unconscious that this experience was a test of character, and when the first excitement was over, felt that they had done well and deserved praise. pickwick, the president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales, poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and short comings. it’s the plague of my life and i was a goose to wear it. the younger men quiz him, it seems, call him old fritz, lager beer, ursa major, and make all manner of jokes on his name. ” “oh, dear, no! it will be delicious, i’m sure,” said meg complacently. ” “that won’t last long. get father’s old guidebooks and read about it. he carefully stirred up the embers of his lost love, but they refused to burst into a blaze. “let him be a musician if he wants to, and not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates to go. just now it’s the fashion to be hideous, to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. it is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles. ” “where will you hop?” “to new york. ” a week later amy did get her reward, and poor jo found it hard to be delighted. i’m satisfied, so please take the money and let’s have supper. ” then she opened her new book and began to read. “let me see. snodgrass, who was tilting back in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read: “the pickwick portfolio” may 20, 18— poet’s corner anniversary ode again we meet to celebrate with badge and solemn rite, our fifty-second anniversary, in pickwick hall, tonight. ” no one did for several months, but the word ‘fete’ always produced a general smile, and laurie’s birthday gift to amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard. i tried both ways, and when it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he just threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room. “i think too much of my looks and hate to work, but won’t any more, if i can help it. “please, ma’am, could i inquire if this highly instructive and charming institution is a new one?” “would you tell him?” asked meg of her sisters. march, with an anxious look. “does this suit you, mr. they drank healths, told stories, sang songs, ‘reminisced’, as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time. ” and demi retired to his mother’s skirts for protection. what those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew, but mr. “rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims, especially the latter part of it. john, dear, here’s your hammer. beth kept her face hidden on her mother’s shoulder, but amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair. as she grew, her mother began to feel that the dovecote would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving as that which had helped to make the old house home, and to pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares. meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons. “oh, jo, can’t you?” “teddy, dear, i wish i could!” that was all, except a little pause. “now, jo, do you think i’d look your mother in the face and say ‘all right’, if it wasn’t?” and laurie stopped short, with an injured air. “i shall tell them myself all about it, and ‘fess’ to mother how silly i’ve been. he had only been waiting till the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred. ” he started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and cried out in a fierce tone, “don’t tell me that, jo, i can’t bear it now!” “tell what?” she asked, wondering at his violence. “why, where is amy’s bottle of cologne?” she added, as the little flask did not appear. “oh, tell me about it! i love dearly to hear people describe their travels. it’s all right you see. and he said it was good, and i shall write more, and he’s going to get the next paid

jo’s oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in the most unsentimental aspects—beating mats with her head tied up in a bandanna, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing cold water over his passion a la gummidge—and an irresistable laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to paint. ” “anything you like, sir. ” “don’t let us do any lessons, beth, for a while, but play all the time and rest, as the girls mean to,” proposed amy. see, i found this and read it. but night came at last, and every time the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each hour brought help nearer. but it was too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor, it disappeared in a most mysterious manner. you may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing project gutenberg™ electronic works provided that: • you pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross

bread is earned, and some privations give sweetness to the few pleasures. ” “i’m glad of it!” muttered jo, tying on her hat with a jerk. oh, pip! oh, pip! how could i be so cruel to you?” cried beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to restore him. “thank you! i’ve read all those, and if you don’t mind, i’d rather talk,” answered laurie. i’m glad you both like what i tell you about him, and hope you will know him some day. go and make yourself useful, since you are too big to be ornamental. “oh, dear no, sir. it’s for the freedmen as well as the chesters, and i think it very kind of them to let me share the labor and the fun. “hush! it won’t come to anything, i dare say, but i couldn’t rest till i had tried, and i said nothing about it because i didn’t want anyone else to

corridor as dark and cold as any tomb. all this surprised and flattered her, though she did not understand it till miss belle looked up from her writing, and said, with a sentimental air. “yes, very selfish,” continued amy, in a calm, cool voice, twice as effective just then as an angry one. he can’t get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and mrs. “he’s too old. ” “you’ll get there, beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,” said jo. people laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them out of sight, and expect them to turn all at once from pretty children into fine young men. “yes, i did!” and meg hid her face again, overcome with shame. as friends you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow over, but i fear you would both rebel if you were mated for

word, when i see one of those harum-scarum girls, i always want to say with our friend cock robin. ” “it can’t be a worse one than some people find in big houses,” retorted meg. tired with her short journey, beth went at once to bed, saying how glad she was to be home, and when jo went down, she found that she would be spared the hard task of telling beth’s secret. shan’t i stop now?’” “she caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her short way, ‘finish the chapter, and don’t be impertinent, miss’. then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her trials. we can’t meddle safely in such matters, and had better not get ‘romantic rubbish’ as you call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship.

characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but audacity becomes young people, and amy’s ambition had a good foundation. “i’ll go on to the first bend, and see if it’s all right before we begin to race,” amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like a young russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap. “and so nice of annie moffat not to forget her promise. if people care more for my clothes than they do for me, i don’t wish to see them. amy and her pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm but more graceful agility, and laurie found himself involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged. march and her husband smiled and nodded at each other with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done well, not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, confidence, and happiness. ” “now my turn,” said fred, as his hand came last. i meant to dine at mother’s. “jo, dear, i want to say one thing, and then we’ll put it by forever. oh, dear me! why weren’t we all boys, then there wouldn’t be any bother. i only want some money,” said laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.

you must come and teach ‘the children’ to keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do, and let us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and friendly together. a. ’ it was very

reception she would give him, they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw him, for dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a tone of unmistakable love and longing. during the

tenderly that there was hardly any need for her to say, “jo, dear, i’m glad you know it. i don’t mean to waste your money, and i didn’t think those little things would count up so. he just stood

asks demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered head. as beth had hoped, the ‘tide went out easily’, and in the dark hour before dawn, on the bosom where she had drawn her first breath, she quietly drew her last, with no farewell but one loving look, one little sigh. jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear. ‘go in and win, my hearties!’ says the captain, and a tremendous fight began. i am here. i often shake you, and you don’t mind,” said jo soothingly. there’s someone ready and glad to go with you, anywhere in the world. her paradise was

good turn in spite of themselves. but he wasn’t, for the moment his father peeped at him, demi’s eyes opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put up his arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, “me’s dood, now. it might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young girl, it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom. ” “you need a motive, mother says, and when you get it, she is sure you’ll work splendidly. laurie didn’t tell us that. “i’d take it manfully, and be respected if i couldn’t be loved,” said amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing about it. amy being gone, laurie was her only refuge, and much as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for he was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the secret from her. “now, i call that lovely of her, don’t you?” cried one girl. pray sit down, i’ll call her. chapter twenty-seven literary lessons fortune

room, i felt as if i was getting on a little in spite of my many failures, for i’m cheerful all the time now, work with a will, and take more interest in other people than i used to, which is satisfactory. it seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things to five-and-twenty. “now she’s mad. ” “what baseness! well, if she abuses you, come to me, and i’ll defend you. ” the last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave him, a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly kiss. beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way, “i don’t know how to express myself, and shouldn’t try to anyone but you, because i can’t speak out except to my jo. ” “you’re a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because you can’t sit in the lap of luxury all the time. ” “would it be right for me to do so too?” asked amy, who in her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that she was apt to forget her little book, now that beth was not there to remind her of it. “yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and we are so fond of them. scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be agreeable, and she performed her mission most successfully. i’m in such a state of exhaustion i can’t get home without help. “i don’t ask you to go alone. out in

shoulders, and a christmas carol issuing from her lips on a pink paper streamer. meg’s eyes kept filling in spite of herself, jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them. in 2001, the project gutenberg literary archive foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for project gutenberg™ and future generations. was he reminding you then?” asked jo softly. ” “didn’t you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?” asked meg, with a shiver. laurence seemed to

agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those provided in paragraph 1. ” “ah, but i didn’t mean to go alone!” and laurie walked fast through the room with an expression which it was well his grandfather did not see. “well, i was wild to do something for father,” replied jo, as they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even in the midst of trouble. ” meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again. mr. mr. the hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for laurie danced well, and taught her the german step, which delighted jo, being full of swing and spring. hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak. “how happy those children seem together!” observed mr. “they are trash, and will soon be worse trash if i go on, for each is more sensational than the last. she had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed

was only rather flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an aristocratic point. “here i am, bag and baggage,” she said briskly. on the second saturday after jo got out of the window, meg, as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the sight of laurie chasing jo all over the garden and finally capturing her in amy’s bower. march gently told meg mr. then the two invalids

happy coming home. the moment he read it, he packed his knapsack, bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians, and was off to keep his promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense. i know it, madame confides in me. his bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but didn’t stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled it up in the droll way he used to do, and jo liked it rampantly erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine forehead a jove-like aspect. you have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of good, and i shall enjoy it, of all things. i picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the professor. i can’t tell you how much i enjoyed your christmas bundle, for i didn’t get it till night and had given up hoping. nobody did, however, and nobody saw beth wipe the tears off the yellow keys, that wouldn’t keep in tune, when she was all alone. ” “well, i despise you. as she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of jo’s mouth. settle your wig, jo, and tell me if i shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything?” asked laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friend’s one beauty. when john comes back, and i see them together, i can judge better of her feelings

jo, for it shows that you are getting on. ” as she spoke, amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that meg hugged her on the spot, and jo pronounced her ‘a trump’, while beth ran to the window, and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle. “now we shall try a new way. ” “aren’t we proud of those two words, and don’t we like to say them?” interrupted jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last. but his polite regrets didn’t impose upon her, and when she galloped away with the count, she saw laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief. she had a little chapel, and in it found solacement for much trouble. from this tin receptacle jo produced another manuscript, and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink. will you call for the money, or shall i send it?” asked mr. “she has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and now she is enjoying herself. “not a bit. “is amy’s illumination anywhere about? i took a fancy to buy that for father,” said jo, very anxious to learn the fate of her sister’s work. “i’m glad it’s over, because we’ve got you back,” whispered beth, who sat on her father’s knee. the kind, brown eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn’t mean to let her know it. tarlatan and tulle were cheap at nice, so she enveloped herself in them on such occasions, and following the sensible english fashion of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices, which were both inexpensive and effective. i shall carry you if you don’t go yourself. boys are trying enough to human patience, goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for teaching than dr. one day beth told her. it won’t last long if you keep going. wouldn’t that console you?” “i rather think it would, but there’s no knowing what may happen in three years,” said jo thoughtfully. i am to have my meals with the children, if i prefer it to the great table, and for the present i do, for i am bashful, though no one will believe it. “you have only to wait, i am to do the work,” said john beginning his labors by picking up meg’s napkin, with an expression which caused jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air of relief as the front door banged, “here comes laurie. “me! i’ve done nothing! what’s she talking about?” cried jo, bewildered. something in mr. ” meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made her reply demurely, “you are very kind, but i’m afraid he won’t come. ‘oh, rise!’ she said, extending a hand of marble fairness. much gratified, jo rushed back to tell the good news, and amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of may’s word and manner. bon voyage,

picture of mr. ’” “there’s no need for me to say it, for everyone can see that i’m far happier than i deserve,” added jo, glancing from her good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass beside her. she lugged it home, cut it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it with salt and butter, for dinner. but after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat amy and one young lady. she went off to get her ball, and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came back, looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently. she enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her heart’s content. “i hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must keep watch over your ‘bosom enemy’, as father calls it, or it may sadden, if not spoil your life. so they asked an old woman what spell they could use to make them happy, and she said, ‘when you feel discontented, think over your

wild to go, and i promised you should when you got through college. you are not like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. ” “my dear, what are they?” “i’ll settle bethy’s troubles, and then i’ll tell you mine. ” “do say some! i can read it, but can’t pronounce. laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys. meg couldn’t refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to see if she would be ‘a little beauty’ after touching up caused her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings toward the moffats. ” “i’m glad of that. “i’ll say ‘nightingales’ then, with laurie. they went to the theater with us, and we did have such a good time, for frank devoted himself to flo, and fred and i talked over past, present, and future fun as if we had known each other all our days. so i got grandpa to say it was high time we did something, and off i pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober, and hannah most took my head off when i proposed a telegram. to be sure, the hall was so narrow it was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been got in whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a tight fit, and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the coalbin. “i’ve been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only succeeded in controlling it. ” jo thought intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided nod at the face opposite, “no thank you, sir, you’re very charming, but you’ve no more stability than a weathercock. her mother thought that there was a trifle too much description. ” “what do you most wish for?” said laurie. “meg, i wish you’d go and see the hummels. and mrs. she liked the ‘laurence boy’ better than ever and took several good looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown creatures to them. regard me in the light of a husband or a carpet, and beat till you are tired, if that sort of exercise agrees with you. ” “what pepper pots you are!” sighed jo. dashwood that morals didn’t sell. “yes, it is. let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy. u. “where’s laurie?” she asked presently, when she had collected her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done. as they gathered about the table, mrs. ” being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she went straight to mr. it was the best thing he could have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for jo felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet solace which affection administers to sorrow. that satisfied her, and without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly way. brooke owned that he liked meg but didn’t dare say so, she was so young and he so poor. ” “successfully, i hope?” said jo, for the bitterness of disappointment was in that short reply of his. “no. for beth, i indulge no hopes except that she may be well. “now, i’ve offended him. his letters were such a comfort, for the home letters were very irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did come. “sensible girls for whom i do care whole papers of pins won’t let me send them ‘flowers and things’, so what can i do? my feelings need a ‘vent’. “will miss amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them lovely silver dishes that’s stored away over yander?” “shouldn’t wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day. moffat reply to one of them. he flattered himself that he knew jo pretty well, and was, therefore, much amazed by the contradictions of voice, face, and manner, which she showed him in rapid succession that day, for she was in half a dozen different moods in the course of half an hour. amy rose daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in hers, and each felt the truth before a word was spoken. what a venerable party!” said jo. when they were called in, laurie was standing by their mother with such a penitent face that jo forgave him on the spot, but did not think it wise to betray the fact. miss jo owes me one, so you are finished,” cried fred excitedly, as they all drew near to see the finish. they looked as if they were at ease, and liked to make him comfortable. ” “no, i came to amuse you. “it can’t seem so without marmee and little pip,” sighed beth, glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head. i’ve something to say to you, and i must free my mind at once. anxious to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said gratefully. now, could she do it? she decided that she would try, and in her first attempt she found the helps i have suggested. what’s yours, meg?” margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and waved a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats, while she said slowly, “i should like a lovely house, full of all sorts of luxurious things—nice food, pretty clothes, handsome furniture, pleasant people, and heaps of money. “wish i was!” “that’s a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life. “it’s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible too, for no one can ever mistake now. i don’t wish to make you vain, but i must confess that i’m prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money. i’d rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly independent. when laurie first went to college, he fell in love about once a month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent, did no damage, and much amused jo, who took great interest in the alternations of hope, despair, and resignation, which were confided to her in their weekly conferences. “i came the minute i heard. march came and took her place among them, looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs. she was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to grandpa. don’t let your husband want anything. “now let us go home, and never mind aunt march today. ” while making these maternal inquiries mrs. laurence looked relieved, evidently taking the whole as a joke. “sir, i give you my word as a gentleman, laurie won’t do anything of the sort. “rather!” “well, in a year or two i’ll send for you, and we’ll dig in the forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we’ve made so many times. ” “that’s my good girl. i don’t believe i could have done it as kindly as you did,” added beth from her pillow. ” “oh, gracious! what shall i say?” cried sallie, as fred ended his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books. wouldn’t that be jolly?” “i never had such a fine bouquet before! how pretty it is!” and meg examined her flowers with great interest. “i’m not sorry,” protested jo, with a choke. i’m far from it now, but i do my best, and hope in time to be what mother is. then i’d try to take an interest in whatever john likes—talk with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and help each other in that way. ” “i’m not,” put in jo decidedly. ” meg spoke seriously and expected to see laurie frown or laugh, but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous way, “i like that! for i’ve seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do. that was unpardonable, and amy took no more notice of him for a long while, except a word now and then when she came to her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a moment’s rest. “all the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband and wife, as the germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside!” cried laurie, promenading down the path with amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur. now do be still, and stop bothering. he’s so absent-minded and goodnatured, he lets those boys ride over him roughshod. march and jo were deep in their own affairs, when a sound from meg made them look up to see her staring at her note with a frightened face. i mean it kindly, and don’t want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the beginning. how funny!” cried jo, taking one up. the good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which jo believed, and felt much relieved as they went up to call meg. jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. it must have possessed some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed to enter into jo, and when laurie came running down with a glass of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, “i drink— health to my beth! you are a good doctor, teddy, and such a comfortable friend. “that’s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and i like it,” said meg, as they set out their presents while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor hummels. “here’s a letter from the old gentleman! come quick, and read it!” “oh, beth, he’s sent you. “if life is often as hard as this, i don’t see how we ever shall get through it,” added her sister despondently. “it is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things. we don’t keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make more trouble if you interfere. ” amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious look in her downcast face that made laurie sit up and say gravely, “now i’m going to play brother, and ask questions. march broke the silence that followed jo’s words, by saying in her cheery voice, “do you remember how you used to play pilgrims progress when you were little things? nothing delighted you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens, give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel through the house from the cellar, which was the city of destruction, up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could collect to make a celestial city. serve me right, selfish pig, to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!” muttered jo, as she went to consult hannah. “i do think that families are the most beautiful things in all the world!” burst out jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted frame of mind just then. to jo alone did the shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum sister beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone in the family. meg had a voice like a flute, and she and her mother led the little choir. i can’t help wishing sometimes, that mother and father hadn’t been so particular about such things. “daisy march—father a colonel in the army—one of our first families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of the laurences; sweet creature, i assure you; my ned is quite wild about her. we thought we were coming directly home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as we were married, found he couldn’t be ready under a month, at least, and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked. “oh, yes, she tries to, but she can’t love bethy as i do, and she won’t miss her as i shall. ” “that’s like you, dear! what will we get?” exclaimed jo. aunt march never petted any one; she did not approve of it, but she meant to be kind, for the well-behaved little girl pleased her very much, and aunt march had a soft place in her old heart for her nephew’s children, though she didn’t think it proper to confess it. she was soon back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, laurie came in with a letter, saying that mr. but the chief grievance that rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct, was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to her, that the march girls had made fun of her at the lambs’. ” “i’ll be agreeable. i’ll go myself,” answered amy, whose temper was beginning to fail. tudor’s uncle had married an english lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and amy regarded the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her american birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which haunts the best of us—that unacknowledged loyalty to the early faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little mother, who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell scolding when he rebelled. 1. “i’m very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to satisfy you,” said mrs. he’d better nip his little passion in the bud, hadn’t he?” added laurie, in a confidential, elder brotherly tone, after a minute’s silence. i flatter myself i’m a ‘gentleman growed’ as peggotty said of david, and when you see amy, you’ll find her rather a precocious infant,” said laurie, looking amused at her maternal air. laurence’s bald head, and ran up to slip the apology under laurie’s door, advising him through the keyhole to be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities. tell me, do you mean to marry this cook? if you do, not one penny of my money ever goes to you. “what shall you tell her?” asked meg, full of curiosity to know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the first time. ” meg went back to toast her feet and read _ivanhoe_, and jo began to dig paths with great energy. it’s simple, but handsome, and those folds over the arm are really artistic. my dear mentor, please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within yourself, for ‘lazy laurence’ has gone to his grandpa, like the best of boys. “if god spares beth, i’ll try to love and serve him all my life,” answered jo, with equal fervor. ” meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose braid, and said approvingly, “it was dreadfully provoking, but you kept your temper, and i’m so glad, jo. “it will decide my career, for if i have any genius, i shall find it out in rome, and will do something to prove it. these offending features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever. he did his best and did it manfully, but i don’t think he found that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine plato, were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home. come at once. “miss eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, i thought,” observed beth, with unusual warmth. laurence sent it,” replied mrs. i freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. forgive me, dear, i can’t help seeing that you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your eyes that goes to my heart. amy has all the fun and i have all the work. bhaer confiscated her purse, produced his own, and finished the marketing by buying several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn. so did mine, but i proved to her that i had talent by taking a few lessons privately, and then she was quite willing i should go on. and if you grow like him she won’t be willing to have us frolic together as we do now. but both felt ill at ease. ” there she stopped, with a look that had both pain and pity in it. that’s all i can do. ” jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her liking for lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of light literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the author’s invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one half the dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over their downfall. i’ve played the part of a prim young lady on the stage, and i’ll try it off. ” “i’ll be a double distilled saint. “it is so beautiful to be loved as laurie loves me. quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for

so dangerously wheedlesome before, “don’t disappoint us, dear! everyone expects it. i’m not so good as you make me, but i have tried to do right. jo would turn up her naughty nose at some of the

have made a man of him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own way, and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort the natural longings and failures of those he loved. then he tied them up, saying, with the happy look jo liked to see, “please give these to your mother, and tell her i like the medicine she sent me very much. ah, no! to me it is a rosary, and as such

as amy had, that day. it came to me all of a sudden that i had one thing to make money out of, and without stopping to think, i walked in, asked if they bought hair, and what they would give for mine. if she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity, it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark. march, with his respectable legs in the air, and beside him, likewise prone, was demi,

boy. “and i needn’t go away, but may stay and be happy, may i, dear?” here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech and the stately exit, but meg never thought of doing either, and

with the bitter drop or two her hardness of heart had wrung from him? she gently turned his head away, saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to grow for her sake—how touching that was, to be sure! “i agree with mother that you and i are not suited to each other, because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably make us very miserable, if we were so foolish as to. i

quite beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister’s ear, she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and finished her fight alone. ” beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not being an angel but a very human little girl, she often ‘wept a little weep’ as jo said, because she couldn’t take music lessons and have a fine piano. laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his seat, and when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she said to herself, with a satisfied smile, “ah, i thought that would do him good!” “you look like balzac’s ‘_femme peinte par elle-meme_’,” he said, as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee cup in the other. ” “yes, sir,” and jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with the sudden squeeze she gave it. mother is always ready to be your confidant, father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives. we fell

and doubles one’s duties. so situated, she was powerless to check jo, who seemed possessed by a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the lady. “it can never be the same again. laurence,” and laurie paused, for amy’s eyes had an absent look, though fixed upon his face. “i shall say i didn’t know you, for you look so grown-up and unlike yourself, i’m quite afraid of you,” he said, fumbling at his glove button. ” amy spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the exasperating martyr at her feet. my powers are great, as you shall see, so be easy in your mind, my child. ” jo went and

it as a woman may for her friend’s good. ” “oh, thank you! it must be so nice to have pocket money! i’ll have a grand feast, for i haven’t tasted a lime this week. ” “how provoking you are! i don’t

the way he’s going to grow up, i wish he’d stay a boy,” she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay. then she wrote a short, simple note, and with laurie’s help, got them smuggled onto the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up. presently he sat up and asked slowly, “do you think jo would despise me as you do?” “yes, if she saw you now. ” as she departed, mr. meg pardoned him, and mrs. i know he wanted to speak, but i think, from something he once hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of

jo. ” and obeying orders, laurie heroically shut his eyes while something was put into his arms. meg was too much absorbed in her private and particular john to care for any other lords of creation, and beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder how amy dared to order them about so, but jo felt quite in her own element, and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the
