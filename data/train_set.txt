comfortable words, as applicable now as when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a paternal priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation possible. she longed to run home, bib and all, and ask mother to lend her a hand, but john and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone with their private

little bewildered by the sudden news. ” “i can’t love anyone else, and i’ll never forget you, jo, never! never!” with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words. when she met him she looked surprised,

ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain her end were not the best. “tell about the party! tell about the party!” with what meg called ‘a great want of manners’ jo had saved some bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing the most thrilling events of the evening. the sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, “heart’s dearest, why do you cry?” now, if jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would have said she wasn’t crying, had a cold in her head, or told any other feminine fib proper to the

lovely of the giant’s treasures, if i remember rightly. no one but beth could get much music out of the old piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang. i rather liked it,” said laurie, looking mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight. march did not say much but looked disturbed, and comforted

can’t make it so. amy knew her good points, and made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to a poor and pretty woman. i couldn’t help loving you if you were seventy!” the

fred. “i’ll be hanged if i do!” and laurie bounced up off the grass, burning with indignation at the very idea. ” “i’m afraid it will be too disagreeable to you,” said meg, trying to look offended and failing entirely. presently she laughed and showed him a small sketch of jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly erect upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, ‘genius burns!’. ”

her well-worn little book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless night, or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears dropped through the transparent fingers, and jo would lie

spot. when she went again, mr. the girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable, especially jo, who had been considered a ‘sancho’ ever since she was born. but everything seemed against her. it’s hard enough to have you change all of a sudden. “no, i didn’t. i’ve tried to show it, but you wouldn’t let me. i’ve tried, but i can’t change the feeling, and it would be a lie to say i do when i don’t. no one said anything, till laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face. meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me jo says because it keeps me sweet tempered. can’t you make them do?” “i can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know how stained they are. “now, beth,” said amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait. now she rides anything, for she doesn’t know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well. the beloved instrument, seldom touched now had not been moved, and above it beth’s face, serene and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon them, seeming to say, “be happy. “do you call him ‘john’?” asked meg, smiling, with her innocent eyes looking down into her mother’s. ” “no, they don’t!” cried jo, aside. mrs. at the word ‘telegraph’, mrs. do you expect company?” “only you, dear. “would you mind telling me what you’d say?” asked jo more respectfully. when she came down, looking like a pretty quakeress in her dove-colored suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say ‘good-by’, as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour. when the music stopped, they sat down on the stairs to get their breath, and laurie was in the midst of an account of a students’ festival at heidelberg when meg appeared in search of her sister. home grew homelike again, and john had no wish to leave it, unless he took meg with him. “never mind what she says. a grove of pines covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp of the crickets. i don’t know what, but i’m on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all some day. so i thought, as a little lesson, i would show you what happens when everyone thinks only of herself. i am a governess myself. pickwick put on a pair of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed, and having stared hard at mr. ” “all may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there is a demand for it, i don’t see any harm in supplying it. march said to the girls, who were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag. mrs. i fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her, that he didn’t admire kate much. brooke, at whom jo glowered darkly, to laurie’s infinite amusement. which is which?” and laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies. she did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared, for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim. ” sitting on the stairs outside meg wondered at the long silence which followed the uproar, and after imagining all sorts of impossible accidents, she slipped into the room to set her fears at rest. “i think you and i could do as well as that if we tried,” returned jo, amused at his admiration of the trash. “that won’t do. “a colliery,” remarks uncle, with a twinkle of the eye. want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people began to go. ” “i will. i’m not ambitious for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name for my girls. she never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to bob like a top-heavy dahlia, i whipped the _vicar of wakefield_ out of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on him and one on aunt. “poor jo! it’s too bad, but it can’t be helped. “not being a genius, like keats, it won’t kill me,” she said stoutly, “and i’ve got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible and absurd, and the scenes that i made up out of my own silly head are pronounced ‘charmingly natural, tender, and true’. “my john wouldn’t marry for money, any more than i would. ” “i’ll try, beth. of course, there were many light-footed, shrill-voiced american girls, handsome, lifeless-looking english ditto, and a few plain but piquante french demoiselles, likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen who disported themselves gaily, while mammas of all nations lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced with their daughters. “goodbye, meggy, i hope the kings won’t strain today. it’s a dull day, but the air isn’t bad, and i’m going to take brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn’t out. meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered their oars with uncommon ‘skill and dexterity’. “don’t be troubled, meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. she never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he was to tell things that helped her so much. home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings. ” the family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked on, and jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth house, and being told that the young ladies were engaged. ” “you don’t know what i can do. “we three will be ready in a minute,” cried amy, running away to wash her hands. meg’s had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it. ” she slept on a couch in the room, waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the patient creature who seldom asked for anything, and ‘tried not to be a trouble’. she knew that little ted would turn up again in time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received him back with a hearty welcome, for jo loved her babies tenderly. each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect “quite easy and fine”. ” he reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit, and by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits mamma by a shrewd bargain. this gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they tried to look as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well till mrs. “miss march, come to the desk. it was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty. s. she also defied her sire, and he ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle. “i’ll try not to be vain,” said amy. kate said once she hoped he’d marry soon, and i quite agree with her that it would be well for him. it’s not much changed,” he answered without enthusiasm. ” “tell me all about it. “quite right, and beautifully written. i’m the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will mold before i can dispose of it,” answered amy, thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this. the air was dark with davises, and many joneses gamboled like a flock of young giraffes. well, you look it,” and jo’s eye plainly betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever. “if meg had four, the house wouldn’t hold them, and master and missis would have to camp in the garden,” broke in jo, who, enveloped in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles. “daisy, dear, i’ve sent an invitation to your friend, mr. laurence found it impossible to go to sleep. i’m glad laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given up smoking and lets his hair grow. ” jo’s only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed left her heart without words. “it’s so early! you can’t mean to go yet?” began jo, looking relieved but hesitating to accept the offer. yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows, and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his grandson. the maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however, for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral pyre, the professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking, and made a dive after the little blue ball. sweets to the sweet, mannling,” and mr. ” no answer for an instant, then laurie asked sharply, “who told you?” “jo herself. ” jo pointed, and laurie sat up to examine, for through an opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river, the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky. one thing, however, rather quenched the vanities. ” what they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close, rejoicing with hearts too full for words. he was staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also, she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, yet something in his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on. everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow, the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even the little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to laurie, for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament. i had a hard time, jo, and shed a good many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts i never seemed to get on. mrs. turning as from a fallen idol, she made other discoveries which rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions. it would trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for i couldn’t fall in love with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could i?” “you are sure of his feeling for you?” the color deepened in jo’s cheeks as she answered, with the look of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young girls wear when speaking of first lovers, “i’m afraid it is so, mother. gutenberg. brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his mischievous pupil. “it’s so hard i’m afraid to try,” said meg, grateful, but bashful in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her. laurie comes naturally by his love of music, for he is like his mother, and i dare say his grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician. then, as if reproaching himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his seldom-used meerschaum, and opened his plato. march. it was gone directly however, for laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity. “i don’t approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls. ” laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having ‘little amy’ order him about, for she had lost her shyness now, and felt an irrestible desire to trample on him, as girls have a delightful way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection. john was a little disappointed not to find a tender niobe, but feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none, only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly relevant remark, “we are going to have a new moon, my dear. there’s the tea bell, i must run and change my cap. they were useful, pretty, or funny, a new standish on his table, a little vase for his flower, he always has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his blower, so that he needn’t burn up what amy calls ‘mouchoirs’. brooke chose meg, kate, and fred. march proudly escorted mrs. happy, thoughtful times there in the old study which jo called ‘the church of one member’, and from which she came with fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit. “going out for exercise,” answered jo with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. before he could say more, a bell rang, and jo flew up, exclaiming with alarm, “mercy me! it’s your grandpa!” “well, what if it is? you are not afraid of anything, you know,” returned the boy, looking wicked. round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned sugar, and mr. no, don’t cry, but hear what a jolly plan i’ve got. “thou shalt haf thy bhaer. she eats and drinks and sleeps like a sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when i talk about that man, and only blushes a little bit when teddy jokes about lovers. ” and jo brought the visit to an end, feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad effect upon her constitution. mr. if you have been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly. but when the helpful voice was silent, the daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained but loneliness and grief, then jo found her promise very hard to keep. “it’s worse than boots, it’s a silk dress,” she said, with the calmness of desperation, for she wanted the worst over. laurence. beth’s bird began to chirp again, and a half-blown rose was discovered on amy’s bush in the window. he said he’d just got a letter begging him to come home, for frank was very ill. “don’t you read german?” asked miss kate with a look of surprise. “i’ll teach you whether we play _hamlet_ or not. but he liked it. jo’s funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of general utility. i wanted the violet silk, but there isn’t time to make it over, so i must be contented with my old tarlaton. i saw you. e. see if the lambs don’t say, ‘what a lively, nice creature that jo march is!” amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when jo turned freakish there was no knowing where she would stop. under the circumstances, what could jo do but greet him civilly, and invite him in? if she was tired of his visits, she concealed her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that there should be coffee for supper, “as friedrich—i mean mr. laurence, hale and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier than ever. the table was just complete then. funny presents, some of them, but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments to grandma’s—for the children’s gifts were all their own. so you’ll not tell, will you?” “i give you my word i won’t, only what shall i say when they ask me?” “just say i looked pretty well and was having a good time. ” laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity, considering the spelling: my last will and testiment i, amy curtis march, being in my sane mind, go give and bequeethe all my earthly property—viz. “no, i don’t. meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage jo was by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything if she did not ask. “you are sure there are no more?” “i never lie, sir. a chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket, and attempts to portray romeo and juliet supplied kindling for some time. when the tea bell rang, jo appeared, looking so grim and unapproachable that it took all amy’s courage to say meekly. beth and i can keep house perfectly well,” put in amy, with an important air. brooke, with her apron over her head, sat sobbing dismally. but you have got on bravely, and i think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,” said mr. john always said what was his was hers, but would he think it right to spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but another five-and-twenty out of the household fund? that was the question. she brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness to the work that she could not but succeed, in spite of some obstacles. “yes, amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were gone, and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start. i am sorry this has happened, but i never allow my rules to be infringed, and i never break my word. i’ll take it to them, and see what’s going on. “i never saw such a girl! you don’t know a compliment when you get it,” said meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all about the matter. i wasn’t sure, no one said anything, and i hoped i was mistaken. c. ” beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the passer-by till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if to herself, “how strong and well and happy that dear boy looks. she wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind during the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in jo’s lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea made music at her feet. at queenstown one of my new acquaintances left us, mr. “not asleep, but so happy, dear. jo thought she was asleep, she lay so still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with wistful eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on beth’s cheeks. i’m afraid i shall do something dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me. march. bhaer stood by, watching her blush and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions, women, like dreams, go by contraries. “how well you draw!” he said, with a genuine surprise and pleasure at her skill, adding, with a half-laugh, “yes, that’s me. the bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you all the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that can part mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some aunt priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart for ‘the best nevvy in the world’. ” “what old man?” demanded jo, thinking he must mean his grandfather. it may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. the sight of the turnovers made jo sober again; and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother’s face. i’ve been sick with this cold so long, and shut up, i’m dying for some fun. ” “that’s bad. jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready. holding on to the banisters, she put him gently away, saying breathlessly, “oh, don’t! i didn’t mean to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do it in spite of hannah that i couldn’t help flying at you. 9. “take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell me what you have been doing with yourself all this while,” said amy, seating herself, ready for a good talk. as the word ‘brotherly’ passed through his mind in one of his reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of mozart that was before him. as few brothers are complimented by having their letters carried about in their sister’s pockets, read and reread diligently, cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully, we will not hint that amy did any of these fond and foolish things. how jo did enjoy her ‘wilderness of boys’, and how poor, dear aunt march would have lamented had she been there to see the sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered plumfield overrun with toms, dicks, and harrys! there was a sort of poetic justice about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror of the boys for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved, and played cricket in the big field where the irritable ‘cow with a crumpled horn’ used to invite rash youths to come and be tossed. ” “play something, amy. “well, now, don’t be dismal, there’s a good fellow. f. the teaching would render her independent, and such leisure as she got might be made profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society would be both useful and agreeable. his last whim had been to bring with him on his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious article for the young housekeeper. a white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the loveliest mantle you ever saw. “why don’t you go yourself?” asked meg. ” here a little hand slipped into his, and beth looked up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest yet timid way. crosspatch, draw the latch, sit by the fire and spin, squalled polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her chair to peep into jo’s face, with such a comical air of impertinent inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing. see, then, my jo—ah, the dear, funny little name—i had a wish to tell something the day i said goodbye in new york, but i thought the handsome friend was betrothed to thee, and so i spoke not. the fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted her attention, and looking up, she saw mr. feeling stronger than ever to meet and subdue her apollyon, she pinned the note inside her frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or bad news. laurence, and that ‘her ladyship’ was altogether a most elegant and graceful woman. “yes, marmee, do you want anything in town? i’ve got to run in and get some paper,” returned jo, pulling out the bow under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at her mother. laurence, for thursday. learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty, meg. “wait till you’ve tried it yourself,” he added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass by the handful. it’s a lovely day, no prospect of rain, and you pride yourself on keeping promises, so be honorable, come and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months. “a gloomy wood,” according to the one playbill, was represented by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a cave in the distance. of course they bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats, wishing they had not left them. ” “yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too far. unless you have removed all references to project gutenberg: 1. don’t interfere, i’ll manage him. john went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it, figuratively speaking. this is no credit to me, you know, i don’t do anything. “you’ve had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear,” said her mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come. laurence, while enjoying. we won’t talk about it now, for it makes me cry, and i want to enjoy you while you stay. ah, happy mother! well i know you hear, like a sweet refrain, lullabies ever soft and low in the falling summer rain. ” “if there is anything good or true in what i write, it isn’t mine. now take these disgusting things two by two, and throw them out of the window. “i’ve known it for a good while, dear, and now i’m used to it, it isn’t hard to think of or to bear. bhaer’s face had lost the absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought, forgetting to compare him with laurie, as she usually did strange men, to their great detriment. “really, truly, dear. i’m used to plodding in the mud,” returned jo, winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly wipe her eyes. she was proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had just heard. ” “how ridiculous you are, jo!” but meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself. mrs. ” “a tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a lamp in its wasted hand,” went on meg. i think i had better go away before it comes to anything. every little plot in the garden soon had its owner. “just as she likes, of course. not a golden penny, exactly, but i doubt if half a million would have given more real happiness then did the little sum that came to her in this wise. “well, little girl, what is it?” replied her mother, in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained ‘the baby’. we are too partial, but the praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets but little money. march. i liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine, so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, i sat there trying to sketch the gray stone lion’s head on the wall, with scarlet woodbine sprays hanging round it. i never knew how good and generous and tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart, and i find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and am so proud to know it’s mine. mr. there a bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat, and rough jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet. have you spoken to her?’ “yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell me by-and-by. i quite long to see the dear man,” added mrs. “yes, i wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully. “where?” “in your face. now hold your shoulder straight, and take short steps, and don’t shake hands if you are introduced to anyone. come to me if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can. ” mrs. nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the united states. she had never read sartor resartus, but she had a womanly instinct that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many than the worth of character or the magic of manners. amy curtis march dear mis march, i jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. and presently, as if the idea had just occurred to him, he said to mrs. “if she goes i shan’t, and if i don’t, laurie won’t like it, and it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and drag in amy. i always imagine it is as it is in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their hands to welcome poor christian as he comes up from the river. ” “i could, if i tried. straws show which way the wind blows, and i’ve made several discoveries today. whatever shall we do?” said jo, looking ready for any measures, however violent. it was capital, but see what a guy it’s made me. of course i shall have rich pupils, also—perhaps begin with such altogether. she did surprise two of them so much that meg started as if she had seen a ghost, and mr. as amy returned from her last trip, mr. do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any project gutenberg™ works unless you comply with paragraph 1. it took his fancy immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece as an article of virtue, so it was rather a failure after all. kirke called to me one day as i passed mr. “i only said i was too young to do anything about it yet, that i didn’t wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak to father. he refused to believe it at first, got angry with himself, and couldn’t understand it, but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things, and time and nature work their will in spite of us. ” while amy dressed, she issued her orders, and jo obeyed them, not without entering her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to amy with an imbecile expression of countenance, saying meekly. she put down her work and got up, thinking, “i will be the first to say, ‘forgive me’”, but he did not seem to hear her. told me he was from berlin, very learned and good, but poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according to the wishes of his sister, who married an american. there are some last things to settle,” said meg, bustling away. here they are, please take them, and forgive me if i was hasty in carrying them away last night. i rather enjoy this, and now i’ll imitate what is called ‘a charming girl’. demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that dodo like to play with ‘the bear-man’ better than she did him, but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he hadn’t the heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its case and freely shaken by ardent admirers. by-and-by jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she could not walk. why don’t you do something splendid, and make her love you?” “i did my best, but it was no use. aunt gave me the ring today. can’t you and meg have it over again?” asked beth, anxiously. believing that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy, industry, and independence, their parents consented, and both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last. “then i must have a lobster, for tongue alone won’t do,” said amy decidedly. excuse the remark, but living among boys, i can’t help using their expressions now and then. ” “good name for it. ” at once, and looked surprised. ” “what did you think of?” “handsome faces—eyes particularly,” answered meg, smiling to herself in the dark. “you will now stand on the platform till recess,” said mr. i often think i ought to go home, but they all say ‘stay’. “beth is very poorly, mother says. ” “what do you know about him?” asked laurie, grateful for the good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak. the friendly frankness was disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret discontent in the heart of each. she remembered that laurie never spoke voluntarily of jo, she recalled the shadow on his face just now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the little old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand. and amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home, that she might work for beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected tasks those willing hands had done for her. the tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen. this maneuver she repeated several times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman lounging in the window of a building opposite. i meant you should attend to it, but i can do it better myself, and things here will get on very well with brooke to manage them. not only did he guess it by the fact that the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no more among newspaper offices, and studied with a dogged patience, which assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with something useful, if not pleasant. it seems that tina is the child of the frenchwoman who does the fine ironing in the laundry here. ” “you really advise it?” and laurie looked at her with an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face. ” “it’s all right. she stood and stared at him for a minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on, saying sharply, “how do you know?” “saw it. having found the place with some difficulty, she went into

another bashful person had chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her, she found herself face to face with the ‘laurence boy’. laurie says he is fast, and i don’t consider him a desirable acquaintance, so i let him alone. such perfect color i never saw, the grass so green, sky so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, i was in a rapture all the way. ” “pray do, it’s quite

change was owing to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits. the ‘queer feeling’ did not pass away, but she imagined herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest her earrings should fly off and get lost or broken. they drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes were all right again. beth’s stage-struck!” cried meg, and the rehearsal ended in a general burst of laughter. the childless old lady had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came, and was much offended because her offer was declined. but we mustn’t stand philandering here. mother “that does me good! that’s worth millions of money and pecks of praise. may’s answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added, with a disagreeable laugh, “very lovely, for she knew she wouldn’t sell them at her own table. so it naturally fell out that meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping with her friend. mrs. i am not a young lady, and it’s only a step. but the piano suffers for want of use. this left jo to her own devices, for mrs. brooke and the umbrella were safely out of the house. brooke, holding the small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen. brooke did it, for this isn’t laurie’s writing. “‘i don’t understand what it’s all about. ought to have called me before,’ he said crossly. , as she put the relics in the rag bag. ” “hang the

bending over it. “don’t i wish i could go as a drummer, a vivan—what’s its name? or a nurse, so i could be near him and help him,” exclaimed jo, with a groan. now she won’t feel so bad about leaving him. you need the exercise, hannah would enjoy the rest, and john would find his wife again. she sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after ‘points of sight’, or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called. she also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests, for aunt march hoarded like a magpie. ” “after i’d seen as much of the world as i want to, i’d like to settle in germany and have just as much music as i choose. laurence are friends, you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together,” and meg hoped they would say no more. ” “i have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an artist, and go to rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best artist in the whole world,” was amy’s modest desire. march, hannah, and john caused him to open them the next minute, to find himself invested with two babies instead of one. in the kitchen reigned confusion and despair. jo soon found that her innocent experience had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which underlies society, so regarding it in a business light, she set about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy. “you don’t care now, but there’ll come a time when that promise will keep you out of mischief, or i’m much mistaken. ” “i always like your games, but if meg doesn’t want me, i’ll go away. my dear creature, she actually rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man!” “did she ride the horse?” “of course she did, and had a capital time. “i’ll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with my music and dolls. i won’t care for it, or let it change me a bit,” thought meg, and rustled across the room to shake hands with her friend. ” “she is coming in the spring, and i mean that you shall be all ready to see and enjoy her. so a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up with the cook’s compliments. “now, gentlemen, i want you to go and do your duty by the other tables as generously as you have by mine, especially the art table,” she said, ordering out ‘teddy’s own’, as the girls called the college friends. she did not rebuke jo with saintly speeches, only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung more closely to the dear human love, from which our father never means us to be weaned, but through which he draws us closer to himself. beth, who was collecting the scattered author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way, “i’m afraid you are tired. “i can’t, for i told meg i wouldn’t, because. ” “no, she’s not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort of thing, unless you’ve suddenly lost your taste for it. i think well of him, and like to show that i do, for he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels. “yes, if you are good, and love your book, as the boys in the primer are told to do,” said meg, smiling. “miss meg march, one letter and a glove,” continued beth, delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother, stitching wristbands. ” “hear! hear!” cried jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan like a cymbal. “mercy, no! don’t ask or tell anyone. as meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she smiled to herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a satisfied tone, “i never need fear that john will be too harsh with my babies. january a happy new year to you all, my dearest

jelly won’t jell and i don’t know what to do!” john brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward, and the derisive scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor meg’s woe. “how will we give the things?” asked meg. bless you! december my precious betsey, as this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, i direct it to you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings on, for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh, be joyful! after what amy would call herculaneum efforts, in the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin to shoot and my little twigs to bend as i could wish. don’t take off your apron, whatever you do, it’s peculiarly becoming,” said laurie, as jo bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered her arm to support his feeble steps. march was the first to recover herself, and held up her hand with a warning, “hush! remember beth. ” “no, no. i should think you’d have known mr. it was not pleasant, but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance offered for proving it. he needs someone to look after him when frank is not with him. you

lecture or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a decided—“leave my children for pleasure, never!” his sleep was broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night. “poor girl, you’re worn out. a regular menagerie appeared in barn and shed, for pet animals were allowed. i’ll help you. it must be recorded of amy that she deliberately prinked that night. we should like to know him, and it’s only a proper compliment to you. contact the foundation as set forth in section 3 below. she went very slowly across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood by him, but he did not turn his head. mrs. don’t croak any more, but come home jolly, there’s a dear. no one said a word about it, but sallie offered to dress her hair, and annie to tie her sash, and belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry from hannah, and then laurie’s voice saying in a joyful whisper, “girls, she’s come! she’s come!” chapter nineteen amy’s will while these things were happening at home, amy was having hard times at aunt march’s. my friends find for me a place in a college, where i teach as at home, and earn enough to make the way smooth for franz and emil. i forgive everyone, and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound. ” “i’m too young,” faltered meg, wondering why she was so fluttered, yet rather enjoying it. “i advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never come home again till you have tried your own way,” said jo, whose imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and whose sympathy was excited by what she called ‘teddy’s wrongs’. i do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes,” said laurie, chewing grass like a meditative calf. there are a good many hard times in this life of ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right way. as usual beth lay on the sofa and laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly ‘spin’, and he never disappointed her. i really couldn’t help it, and it all came about in such a droll

“but you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down on his knees, won’t you?” “very likely. brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river. hope and faith, born of my sorrow, guardian angels shall become, and the sister gone before me by their hands shall lead me home. “well, i wash my hands of the whole affair! you are a willful child, and you’ve lost more than you know by this piece of folly. laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked. sallie moffat renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of gossip at the little house, or inviting ‘that poor dear’ to come in and spend the day at the big house. “i’ve been routed up early all winter and had to spend my days working for other people, so now i’m going to rest and revel to my heart’s content. there’s the tea bell, we have it early on the boy’s account. i’d go myself, if i was any use. grundy, but it’s true nevertheless. “das

appeared in his face, and by the time the paper was turned, and jo’s needle threaded, he was ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely. how they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming how many love letters that little post office would hold in the years to come. “for mrs. so nothing came of these trials, and jo corked up her inkstand, and said in a fit of very wholesome humility. why mr. it was a sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of, for no one had any objection to make. “not at all. brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile. “i don’t know anything. “very well, you can have it,” said jo, handing back the story with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work, even twenty-five seemed good pay. people have been very kind to me, and whenever i see girls struggling along, as we used to do, i want to put out my hand and help them, as i was helped. ” “your what?” cried jo, for laurie uttered those two words with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him. kate is older than you, fred and frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (grace), who is nine or ten. “shall i tell my friend you will take another if she has one better than this?” asked jo, unconscious of her little slip of the tongue, and emboldened by her success. the fat turkey was a sight to behold, when hannah sent him up, stuffed, browned, and decorated. “dear fellows! it does my heart good to see them forget business and frolic for a day,” answered jo, who now spoke in a maternal way of all mankind. “we ought to rehearse tonight. the fairy queen’s yellow curls reminded her of amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering what her sister would do to make her ‘sorry for it’. swarthy boys and dark-eyed madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio, suggested murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants, rubens; and turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor’s shirt or a king’s robe, as the spectator pleased. “certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that they intend to do it sometimes. but

him about the house like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is very fond of children, though a ‘bacheldore’. home is a nice place, though it isn’t splendid,” said meg, looking about her with a restful expression, as she sat with her mother and jo on the sunday evening. smart maids, with the rosiest children i ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer english hats and lavender kids lounging about, and tall soldiers, in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side, looking so funny i longed to sketch them. they availed themselves of the rare privilege to the fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking milk while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were sown broadcast over the field, and apple turnovers roosted in the trees like a new style of bird. the old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and, stooping down, he kissed her, saying, in a tone few people ever heard. mrs. there was the garnet set which aunt march wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover’s diamonds, the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn, uncle march’s big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay aunt march’s wedding ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all. i only did as i’d be done by. beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever. ” for a moment jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as the plan was, it just suited her. there was no need of having a scene, hardly any need of telling amy that he loved her, she knew it without words and had given him his answer long ago. “i know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know what they mean. there are some pleasant people in the house if you feel sociable, and your evenings are always free. ” while laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests under their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers, and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, amy watched him, and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was changed, and she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in the moody-looking man beside her. moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to make her a present of it immediately afterward. taking no more notice of her than if she had been a fly, mr. it’s all settled, and can be carried out at once,” said mr. but he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, “did you have a bad time?” “not very. “it’s like his writing,” faltered meg, comparing it with the note in her hand. timidly she crept from her lattice, put her hand on roderigo’s shoulder, and was about to leap gracefully down when “alas! alas for zara!” she forgot her train. there was color, light, and life in the boy’s face now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh. ” “and amy, what is she going to do?” asked mrs. ” a demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. “no, to remind me not to be selfish. there must be ways, it can’t be too late. a. ” “may i know the others?” jo looked up and jo looked down, then said slowly, with sudden color in her cheeks. i don’t let the girls hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and

“i’m glad to hear you say so, dear, for i was afraid home would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters,” replied her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day. “and hairpins,” added laurie, throwing half a dozen into jo’s lap. “you think then, that it is better to have a few duties and live a little for others, do you?” “lounging and larking doesn’t pay,” observed jo, shaking her head. her keen eyes filled, and when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so. the poor fellow had temptations enough from without and from within, but he withstood them pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good faith and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather, and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of the women who loved him, and say “all’s well,” kept him safe and steady. i wish he would go too. we won’t ask for jelly. “there isn’t any, laurie is only a little boy. “i suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this spick-and-span bower, so as i’m tremendously hungry, i propose an adjournment,” he added presently. ” “that ever i should live to see you a henpecked husband and enjoying it!” cried jo, with uplifted hands. i should be afraid she might overdo, if i didn’t know her ‘moral fit’ wouldn’t last long. i had a young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had finger bowls for company and that satisfied her,” said mrs. “they are lovely. brooke was only interested in domestic news. beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving. brooke couldn’t understand why your mother was so kind to him, asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly way. on the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated with cordial good nights and good-byes, for the vaughns were going to canada. “it will be an immense care for jo,” said meg, stroking the head of her one all-absorbing son. he isn’t as handsome as my grandfather, but i like him. it’s like the tide, jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can’t be stopped. “is your secret a nice one?” “oh, isn’t it! all about people you know, and such fun! you ought to hear it, and i’ve been aching to tell it this long time. a white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its silvery breast. gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids, no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to the old, protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of rank, age, or color. laurence, but says he’s very proud and doesn’t like to mix with his neighbors. “i want you to read that, please, and tell me if it is legal and right. remember it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick temper, before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you have known today. ’” continued the perplexed authoress. gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage, fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights, the maritime alps rose sharp and white against the blue italian sky. we are pining for a visit. “i was wrong, i didn’t know. but she certainly did grow a little pale and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society, and went out sketching alone a good deal. that was a very happy breakfast, though they didn’t get any of it. “why, girls, you needn’t praise me so. e. ” “s’ant!” replied the young rebel, helping himself to the coveted ‘cakie’, and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity. they are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes. i know it’s so, for i can’t read this stuff in sober earnest without being horribly ashamed of it, and what should i do if they were seen at home or mr. he was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her until quite close, when he would look as if his short-sighted eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that moment. laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it from the seat he most coveted next to jo in the sofa corner. “here’s a lovely flock of lambs all lying down,” says amy. “we never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play we are playing all the time in one way or another. the lady was young, blonde, and dressed in blue. i

that, where we shall go, by-and-by, when we are good enough,” answered meg with her sweetest voice. i like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too preachy,” said jo, after a minute’s silence. little teddy bore a charmed life, for nothing ever happened to him, and jo never felt any anxiety when he was whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on the back of another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa, who labored under the germanic delusion that babies could digest anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own small shoes. ”

recovered spirit enough to rebel, they were off. it took several strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she got there, the other side had nearly won, for kate’s ball was the last but one and lay near the stake. we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, meg. bhaer would have gone decorously away, and come again another day, but how could he, when jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat? perhaps her face had something to do with it, for she forgot to hide her joy at seeing him, and showed it with a frankness that proved irresistible to the solitary man, whose welcome far exceeded his boldest hopes. the short afternoon wore away. this suited the young lady better than twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and eloquent glances of the eye, for with jo, brain developed earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter were less manageable. march had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a long while. one july day she came in with her hands full, and went about the house leaving letters and parcels like the penny post. ” “‘cabbages!’” continued laurie promptly. let him feel that he has a part to do, and he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be better for you all. he has friends there and

having treated mr. “scold as much as you like, you’ll never see your silly old book again,” cried amy, getting excited in her turn. the fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn. she rushed to the door when the postman rang, was rude to mr. ” “he won’t come, sir. “i saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows how to behave. ” being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him shake off the apathy that so altered him, amy sharpened both tongue and pencil, and began. for forty years, he produced and distributed project gutenberg™ ebooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. in vain amy telegraphed the word ‘talk’, tried to draw her out, and administered covert pokes with her foot. “don’t spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than you know, and the idea is well worked out. i’ve got them all, thank god, and am the happiest woman in the world,” and meg laid her hand on her tall boy’s head, with a face full of tender and devout content. march saw something on the lifted hand that made her smile. “well, if that isn’t the greatest rubbish i ever heard,” cried jo indignantly. for two or three hours the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing jo seated on the old sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out upon a trunk before her, while scrabble, the pet rat, promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied by his oldest son, a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of his whiskers. thank you very, very much!” meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would call her mother. “oh, oh, oh! what have you done? i’m spoiled! i can’t go! my hair, oh, my hair!” wailed meg, looking with despair at the uneven frizzle on her forehead. “so i did! well, i am happy, and i won’t fret, but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn’t it? there now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which i shall leave for mother to pack,” said meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton, which she called her ‘ball dress’ with an important air. very likely some mrs. i struggled along as well as i could, but jo was too much for me. you have played so many pranks that i am afraid you have had a hand in this. he did not do much, but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of some sort going on in spite of himself. bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for tina, and then ordered out the shawls. he consents without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus, and the curtain falls upon the lovers kneeling to receive don pedro’s blessing in attitudes of the most romantic grace. the dustpan society will meet on wednesday next, and parade in the upper story of the club house. ” she said, with her most grown-up air. i don’t know what i should do if you acted like mr. i was just thinking i’d offer to put them back, for they belong to your table rather than mine. god was not a blind force, and immortality was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact. it’s a great misfortune to have such strong likes and dislikes, isn’t it?” “it’s a greater not to be able to hide them. jo chapter thirty-four friend though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it sweeter for the effort, jo still found time for literary labors. since the party, she had been more eager than ever, and had planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not been seen lately, and jo began to think he had gone away, when she one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down into their garden, where beth and amy were snow-balling one another. people who hire all these things done for them never know what they lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them, and meg found so many proofs of this that everything in her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on her parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender forethought. ” “you are a thing of beauty and a joy forever,” said jo, looking through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather against the golden hair. “i was worried at first and meant to tell you, then i remembered how you liked mr. yours respectful, hannah mullet head nurse of ward no. if i ask him to stay, he’ll think i’m jealous, and i

turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding words, and grateful hearts, full of love for ‘mother bhaer’. “they do sometimes,” said a muffled voice from the post. fifteen minutes after aunt march’s departure, jo came softly downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying to herself, “she has seen him away as we planned, and that affair is settled. amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient exclamation. i’d rather you wouldn’t,” said meg, taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover’s patience and her own power. with a half-repentant, half-amused expression, laurie gathered up all jo’s letters, smoothed, folded, and put them neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew it off, laid it with the letters, locked the drawer, and went out to hear high mass at saint stefan’s, feeling as if there had been a funeral, and though not overwhelmed with affliction, this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than in writing letters to charming young ladies. ” “i don’t believe he would. it was

excellent education, and has much talent. amy’s dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed may’s painted vases—that was one thorn. “oh, bless you, no! but she let old belsham rest, and when i ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at the vicar that she didn’t hear me laugh as i danced a jig in the hall because of the good time coming. “what does the goose mean?” said meg, laughing and trying to look unconscious. ” “capital boys, aren’t they? i feel quite young and brisk again after that. “i’d wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment,” cried laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side and gravely croaked, “allyluyer! bless your buttons, dear!” “now i’m ready,” said amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a piece of paper out of her pocket. “yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive. mrs. ” “good! good!” cried jo, pounding with the handle of the old warming pan on which she leaned. “yes, i want some twilled

is evident he begins to care for you?” and mrs. everyone thought soberly for a minute, then meg announced, as if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands, “i shall give her a nice pair of gloves. i rather think she hasn’t got any,” said her mother. march received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily over it after jo was gone. softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good, and amy’s hair, jo’s nose, meg’s mouth, and laurie’s eyes were pronounced ‘wonderfully fine’. he isn’t one of the cool, stiff englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has scotch blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes. beth isn’t selfish, and that’s the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the thoughts of losing her. ” “isn’t a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year grind?” “you don’t look as if you’d had much. they disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply because she was old and poor and had few friends. two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in which sat beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a little fruit. if you had just reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right,” said amy reprovingly. jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected turning of the tables actually took her breath away. w. ” there was no answer except her sister’s cheek against her own, not even tears, for when most deeply moved, jo did not cry. old hannah never wearied of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite, dropping tears as she worked, and from across the sea came little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to bring breaths of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter. ” laurie retired to the window, and jo told her story. try it, dear. march is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in meg’s affairs that the

careful than ever now, for i’ve had warning from susie’s downfall,” said amy morally. a moment was allowed for the first thrill to subside, then hugo, the villain, stalked in with a clanking sword at

the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden. “i’ll get a little bottle of cologne. bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who knocks at a strange door,

satisfied. he is well, and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared. ” this was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement. ” though a very social man, i think mr. amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle among them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift of fascination with which she was endowed. march got her wet things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy chair, drew amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour of her busy day. all walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate, and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river. n. she sang like a little lark about her work, never was too tired for marmee and the girls, and day after day said hopefully to herself, “i know i’ll get my music some time, if i’m good. they were all there, his grandfather—oh, so proud—mr. remember that, and

jo? dear me! how happy and good we’d be, if we had no worries!” said meg, who could remember better times. ” and, to the dismay of the rest of the club, jo threw open the door of the closet, and

him welcome if he comes. bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh, and jo cried out, with a scandalized face. up rose snodgrass, very much in earnest. bhaer, more like a romantic student than a grave professor. ” jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits should come on just then, and made her preparations with a lightened heart, for beth seemed more cheerful, and hoped she was doing the best for all. she had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, “if amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she’d know exactly what to do. the house bills were all paid, the books all in order. you can do as you please, but i shall keep my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon as i wake, for i know it will do me good and help me through the day. “it was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots. “i don’t like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a slave. but i was going to say that while i was dawdling about abroad, i saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices, and enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams. i don’t care what becomes of me,” and laurie got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather’s ear. beth was soon able to lie on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll’s sewing, which had fallen sadly behind-hand. from that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady complacently admired the success of her training. there are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with father and mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the best lover of all comes to give you your reward. but she could not find enough to satisfy her, for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting. ” “that is your best friend, of whom you speak?” he said in an altered tone. oh, jo, the baby’s dead!” “what baby?” “mrs. ” “do you care for nuts?” “like a squirrel.

took peculiar pleasure in granting beth’s requests because she so seldom asked anything for herself. “i don’t approve of the match, but i’ve made up my mind to bear it, and shall not say a word against it,” said jo solemnly. he’s very kind, though he does not look so, and he lets me do what i like, pretty much, only he’s afraid i might be a bother to strangers,” began laurie, brightening more and more. ” as she spoke, mrs. ” “i wish i’d known that nice girl. “shall we see you this evening, mon frere?” asked amy, as they parted at her aunt’s door. “i understand. ” “you must sit still

he was not offended, he made himself as agreeable as possible, wound cotton for meg, recited poetry to please jo, shook down cones for beth, and helped amy with her ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the ‘busy bee society’. ” “how much will pay them off and restore your credit?” asked meg, taking out her purse. in this room there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with

made it rather cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill the professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely. aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she couldn’t say a word. the dream of filling home with comforts, giving beth everything she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom, going abroad herself, and always having more than enough, so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been for years jo’s most cherished castle in the air. tudor, who happened to be calling likewise, jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the change refreshing. what do you down here, my friend?” “i’m shopping. blimber. in this one little was said of the hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness

conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to display them,” said mrs. it is not well, and i haf no patience with those who make this harm. as he sat down beside her, amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of her impulsive greeting. “to the devil!” was the consoling answer. ” “she doesn’t look like my jo any more, but i love her dearly for it!” as everyone exclaimed, and beth hugged the cropped head tenderly, jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle, and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked it, “it doesn’t affect the fate of the nation, so don’t wail, beth. what did the little mary say to that?” asked mr. while the cooking mania lasted she went through mrs. then she begged him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little corner of his heart for his loving sister jo. ” “would you like to go?” asked amy, thoughtfully patting her nose with her knife. viola and angelo are two of our favorite names, isn’t that queer?” said meg, wiping her eyes, for the lovering part was tragical. “go on, go on!” added winkle and tupman, while the president bowed benignly. “my dear, don’t get angry about it, and i will tell you how it happened. how can i ever pay you?” she added, as the wine refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind. now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and fred has just gone. meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent, and i only got some clothes with mine, so i felt wicked, and was bound to have some money, if i sold the nose off my face to get it. now florence’s mama hadn’t a particle of taste, and amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not fit. how came you to be awake?” “i can’t sleep, i’m so anxious,” said meg. march came home, and, having heard the story, soon brought amy to a sense of the wrong she had done her sister. “we’re an ambitious set, aren’t we? every one of us, but beth, wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect. e. fired with a housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly. i must look after grace, she is romping. it’s going to the church of st. so meg gave her the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she

and cuddled by faithful hannah, they found beth lying, as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen asleep. the very cattle looked more tranquil than ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had a contented cluck, as if they never got nervous like yankee biddies. 1. “thank you, i prefer spiders,” she replied, fishing up two unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death. “the note is from mother, and the flowers from laurie,” said meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her. she started when spoken to, blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing, with a timid, troubled look on her face. jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the money did not pay for her share of the sensation, but going to the other extreme, as is the way with people of her stamp, she took a course of mrs. one night when beth looked among the books upon her table, to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that was almost as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of her old favorite, pilgrims’s progress, she found a little paper, scribbled over in jo’s hand. roderigo and don pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many were speechless with laughter. there was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on the willow by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind. her turn came next. i’ve told him he must go to sleep, as you bid him, and he must, if i stay here all night. to may’s great delight, mr.

to a pleasant green meadow where lilies bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do now, before they went on to their journey’s end,” answered beth, adding, as she slipped out of her father’s arms and went to the instrument, “it’s singing time now, and i want to be in my old place. ” while she blushed and blundered, mr. march paused a minute just there, and after a glance at meg, who was violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring lift of the eyebrows, i leave you to imagine. the front is all right. meg lifted her eyebrows, but jo scowled at her defiantly and said at once, “of course you may. during one of her play hours she wrote out the important document as well as she could, with some help from esther as to certain legal terms, and when the good-natured frenchwoman had signed her name, amy felt relieved and laid it by to show laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness. i made the music for father, because he likes the verses. the old beliefs, that had lasted so long, seemed better than the new. davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust added to his wrath. here’s a line, and there’s another.

of tea. ” “that’s a fib!” cried jo, taking her by the shoulders, and looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than amy. “mother did it. amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had rather have the fever than go to aunt march. “i hate to be patronized, and the chesters think it’s a great favor to allow us to help with their highly connected fair. “girls, girls! have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?” “yes, yes, spandy nice, and meg has cologne on hers,” cried jo, adding with a laugh as they went on, “i do believe marmee would ask that if we were all running away from an earthquake. ” “father and mother don’t think so. jo still looked like a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day. don’t be anxious about me, remember i am your ‘prudent amy’, and be sure i will do nothing rashly. ” she did not finish her speech, for belle shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly. it was such a surprise to look up and find you, just as i was beginning to fear you wouldn’t come,” she said, trying in vain to speak quite naturally. aunt march likes to have us pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call. “i was detained by the way, but i promised to spend christmas with you, and here i am. amy stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and

alone with the refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and at five o’clock sat down in her topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands, lifted up her voice and wept. meg smiled and relented,

bijou. ” “oh, did she?” and mr. the carriages were promised, meg and mother were all ready to do the honors, beth was able to help hannah behind the scenes, jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights, for the ‘cherry bounce’ and the broken bridge were her strong points. “why?” asked meg, looking surprised. the evenings were the worst of all, for aunt march fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so unutterably dull that amy was always ready to go to bed, intending to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before she had squeezed out more than a tear or two. we can’t do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. behold ambition on

minute, and the expression of his face puzzled jo when he said very gently, “never mind that. “of what is this fine crop to consist, ma’am?” “boys. amy’s definition of jo’s idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable turn. there was a dentist’s sign, among others, which adorned the entrance, and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine set of teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat, and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying with a smile and a shiver, “it’s like her to come alone, but if she has a bad time she’ll need someone to help her home. an hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was, scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression, which caused mrs. the other gentlemen speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers, painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate purchases. no one disturbed her, and she used to lie there on beth’s little red pillow,

put the question to which she had once decided to answer, “yes, thank you,” but now she said, “no, thank you,” kindly but steadily, for when the time came, her courage failed her, and she found that something more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and fears. poor john! i’m afraid i have neglected him sadly, but i thought i

spirit in its prison-house of pain. to hannah i give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork i leave hoping she ‘will remember me, when it you see’. ” “you always were my docile daughter. and there was laurie, with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other. with much difficulty and some danger she was dug out, for jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least. ” amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn’t in good taste, but laurie liked her better for it, and found himself both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most of opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with flowers. he hasn’t any business,

young man walked slowly, with his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression of countenance. march’s grave face relaxed, in spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel. laurence’s protection. “i merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to every

not loved jo very much, i don’t think he could have done it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and her bonnet a ruin. ” “i’ll tell you what we’ll do,” said beth, “let’s each get her something for christmas, and not get anything for ourselves. “it does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company manners on all the time. hannah hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive and elegant. when she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod. ” “then why don’t you do it?” “natural depravity, i suppose. money doesn’t stay in his pocket long enough to lay up any. ” “we do. there never was such a woman for givin’ away vittles and drink, clothes and firin’,” replied hannah, who had lived with the family since meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant. nice thing, isn’t it?” and laurie gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears. jo never left her for an hour since beth had said “i feel stronger when you are here. the little back is too young to haf such heaviness. “please do now. mr. the two older girls were a great deal to one another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her keeping and watched over her in her own way, ‘playing mother’ they called it, and put their sisters in the places of discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of little women. i’d do as much for our jimmy any day if i had a spire of hair worth selling. “who did it?” demanded jo. as she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. jo skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the dangerous object of her visit. “what shall we do with that girl? she never _will_ behave like a young lady,” sighed meg, as she watched the race with a disapproving face. nobody spoke for a minute; then meg said in an altered tone, “you know the reason mother proposed not having any presents this christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. “bring a rail. ” “she’s very busy. “last summer meg left a pair of gloves over at the laurences’ and only one was returned. “too stormy for me with my cold. she put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and went

look that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the gods. ” “i wanted to save you this. “and i hope aunt march won’t croak. aunt’s pronunciation is old-fashioned, and flo and i,

were to do her honor, went to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near by. i’ve been through something of it, and i know all about it. now i know mother will shake her head, and the girls say, “oh, the mercenary little wretch!”, but i’ve made up my mind, and if fred asks me, i shall accept him, though i’m not

had been disappointed of a day’s work. this is a ladies’ club, and we wish to be private and proper. ” “thank you, sir,” and jo was quite comfortable after that, for it suited her exactly. “quite safe, dear. meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking encyclopedia of useful knowledge. you know mrs. everything turned out well, which was a mercy, hannah said, “for my mind was that flustered, mum, that it’s a merrycle i didn’t roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey with raisins, let alone bilin’ of it in a cloth. ” “that sounds well. ” she began solemnly. “such fun! only see! a regular note of invitation from mrs. oh, it would be all i should ask! and i’d rather have it than any title such as girls snap up so readily, and find nothing behind. she was affecting to write busily one saturday afternoon, when she and beth were alone together. baron rothschild’s private secretary, a large-nosed jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the world, as if his master’s name crowned him with a golden halo. cornelius’s receipt book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the problems with patience and care. but it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets, and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not work. her sisters braided up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley, which ‘her john’ liked best of all the flowers that grew. laurie went back to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of nice had improved him wonderfully, and he had better try it again. her grandfather often called her ‘beth’, and her grandmother watched over her with untiring devotion, as if trying to atone for some past mistake, which no eye but her own could see. “of course they will, they are used to it now. s. i’m going into business with a devotion that shall delight grandfather, and prove to him that i’m not spoiled. i want to see it go wound. she telegraphed her wish to meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. “‘just the thing,’ said the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden. to her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly, “you’re right, girl, i am! i love the boy, but he tries my patience past bearing, and i know how it will end, if we go on so. ” and, to the utter amazement of the assembled family, beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the hedge, and in at the laurences’ door. she soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated purse grew stout, and the little hoard she was making to take beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as the weeks passed. “i’m all ready for the secrets. ” “she was kind, but not in the right way, and it’s lucky for her she didn’t love me, if i’m the good-for-nothing fellow you think me. bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments fly away on the wind. chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to deliver this little speech, but when the time came, she found it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with amy’s unsuspicious eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble. “how beautifully you do it! i wish i could draw,” said meg, with mingled admiration and regret in her voice. she was mortally afraid of being laughed at for surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of independence. “how shall i behave here?” she asked, as they approached the third mansion. he looks as if he’d like to know us but he’s bashful, and meg is so prim she won’t let me speak to him when we pass,” said jo, as the plates went round, and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction. ” leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper and wrote to jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything while there was the least hope of her changing her mind. if anyone had known the care lavished on that dolly, i think it would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed. ” “stir away, it won’t hurt me and it may amuse you, as the big man said when his little wife beat him. also why mrs. jo happened to suit aunt march, who was lame and needed an active person to wait upon her. laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner. john saw in a minute that a revolution of some kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing that meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn’t keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would soon appear. i’m not a fashionable party and don’t mean to be, but i do like harmless larks now and then, don’t you?” “yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don’t get wild, will you? or there will be an end of all our good times. ” “don’t, that’s her name for me!” and laurie put up his hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in jo’s half-kind, half-reproachful tone. ” “then don’t go and be suspicious. do, meg! i’ll be ever so good,” pleaded amy, looking as pathetic as she could. “i just will, though, for it’s capital, so shady, light, and big. “happy as a queen, the dear! every soul of ’em is upstairs a worshipin’. much elated with her success, jo did ‘tell on’, all about their plays and plans, their hopes and fears for father, and the most interesting events of the little world in which the sisters lived. “don’t go to school, i’m a businessman—girl, i mean. ” “you have been running, jo. “run, beth, and help hannah clear half the things off the table. as she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister’s things, but saw no sign of them. “we were only talking. “i gave my best to the country i love, and kept my tears till he was gone. ” “do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?” and jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page. “beth, if you don’t keep these horrid cats down cellar i’ll have them drowned,” exclaimed meg angrily as she tried to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and stuck like a burr just out of reach. “why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don’t care a sixpence for you? i thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears french boots and rides in a coupe,” said jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises. the dim, dusty room, with the busts staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which she could wander where she liked, made the library a region of bliss to her. hold up your dress and put your hat on straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the first puff. how odd! teddy never seals mine,” said jo next day, as she distributed the contents of the little post office. “come and take a walk, my dear?” cried polly, hopping toward the china closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar. i didn’t think that of you. “is that all?” “not quite,” stammered amy. chapter twenty-nine calls “come, jo, it’s time. “how is the little dear?” asked laurie, for beth was his especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show. thank gott, we germans believe in sentiment, and keep ourselves young mit it. “what’s the name?” asked beth, wondering why jo kept her face behind the sheet. march. ” “have someone come and see you then. “to you and your sisters. it was easy to keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories. i can bear anything better than that. ” “frost opens chestnut burrs, ma’am, and it takes a good shake to bring them down. it’s honest work, and i’m not ashamed of it. “tucked away out of sight, i dare say,” thought jo, who could forgive her own wrongs, but hotly resented any insult offered her family. she tried to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought that prompted the half-involuntary impulse, laurie held it fast, and said, with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before. he never goes with flo, always gets on my side of the carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we are alone, and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak to me. ” “who, sir?” stopping to listen. “i suppose you are going to college soon? i see you pegging away at your books, no, i mean studying hard. “please let me kiss him once, john?” “certainly. the old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four cups of tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not escape him. ” “that boy put it into his head, i know he did! he’s a capital fellow, and i wish we could get acquainted. “i like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so i’ve no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes. i’ll tell you how we can manage. i don’t think his family would object, and i should be very happy, for they are all kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me. 1. he did not soon forget the reproachful glance amy gave him, as she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom, snatched her things, and left the place “forever,” as she passionately declared to herself. the windows were open, and jo, walking in the garden with beth, for once understood music better than her sister, for he played the ‘_sonata pathetique_’, and played it as he never did before. they looked very well in their simple suits, meg’s in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and the pearl pin. , and i don’t want

told the marches that they had lost all chance of being remembered in the rich old lady’s will, but the unworldly marches only said. i told him to go to sleep alone, and here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering over that canvas,” said meg, answering the call. ” “i thought you’d find it so. march safely at home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls all mankind ‘brother’, the piety that blossoms into character, making it august and lovely. ” “i thought you’d be pleased. i wonder if i should blossom out half as well as you have, if i tried it?, always _‘perwisin’_ i could,” said jo, as she constructed a kite for demi

events. no stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies. ” “yes,” said jo, knitting her brows, “that’s just it. march said sorrowfully. “yes,” she would say, looking in the glass, “i’m getting old and ugly. i don’t wish to be unjust or suspicious, but i shouldn’t wonder if they never came at all. when aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile, she said very humbly, “father, talk to me as you did to beth. if jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in the balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a minute, but unfortunately, we don’t have windows in our breasts, and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends. such hours are beautiful to live, but very hard to describe, so i will leave it to the imagination of my readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine happiness, and that meg’s tender hope was realized, for when beth woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which her eyes fell were the little rose and mother’s face. “aunt march went today, for which, oh, be joyful!” said jo. ” “don’t say that. 7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. after that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful spirit that came and went unseen. “please don’t—it’s—it’s mine,” murmured amy, with a face nearly as red as her fish. it was not a wise thing to do, but i kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some clothes. four sisters, parted for an hour, none lost, one only gone before, made by love’s immortal power, nearest and dearest evermore. when all was settled, with fear and trembling she told laurie, but to her surprise he took it very quietly. that night he looked as if he would like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified at her extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of his prudent wife. and jo wouldn’t be kind to you? why, i was sure she loved you dearly. beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. ” “you might treat him civilly, at least. to our venerable benefactor mr. the foundation’s ein or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. meg forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch hold of jo, with an exclamation of pain. i wanted you to see her, but they have spoiled her entirely. ” “i don’t mind,” laughed laurie, as he settled his tie. carrol, florence’s mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply of house and table linen, and send it as her present, all of which was faithfully done, but the secret leaked out, and was greatly enjoyed by the family, for aunt march tried to look utterly unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride. march smiled and was satisfied. ” “wouldn’t you have a master for your castle in the air?” asked laurie slyly. here it is, and we never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping you have done,” cried jo, with the loving impetuosity which she never would outgrow. gardiner’s dressing room after a prolonged prink. it’s dull as tombs up here. “may i come again?” asked laurie. you may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the project

house was neglected, and kitty, the cook, who took life ‘aisy’, kept him on short commons. time and absence had done its work on both the young people. let’s hear the sound of the baby pianny,” said hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows. “my poor dear, how dreadful for you! i ought to have gone,” said jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her mother’s big chair, with a remorseful face. it’s dull, sitting by myself,” answered frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at home. i won’t have anything of the sort in my house. just recollect the good aunts who have not only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips they have given you from their small store, the stitches the patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little attentions that women love to receive as long as they live. “i’ll take a leaf out of her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not grudge her one minute of happiness. s. couldn’t we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out there in germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?” said laurie, when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden. amy teased jo, and jo irritated amy, and semioccasional explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward. the parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself by being as mischievous as possible. making a dart at the table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled, thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back. bhaer?” “oh, that’s the trouble is it? i thought there was something in the dimple that didn’t quite suit you. there was a good deal to show, and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it. i only let her go. laurie devoted himself to the little ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket, took daisy up among the bird’s nests, and kept adventurous rob from breaking his neck. when they got home, they found amy reading in the parlor. ” “little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,” said amy, when sallie’s invention gave out. “i am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and deserved some punishment for disobedience,” was the severe reply, which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but sympathy. ” that was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself, and meg walked away, saying petulantly, “you are the rudest boy i ever saw. “i dote upon it. i shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop to such pranks at once. “john, dear, i’m ashamed to show you my book, for i’ve really been dreadfully extravagant lately. now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is. when do you begin your great work of art, raphaella?” he asked, changing the subject abruptly after another pause, in which he had been wondering if amy knew his secret and wanted to talk about it. ” and having delivered her defiance all on one breath, meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the field to bemoan herself in her own room. “fib number one. i shall see and hear new things, get new ideas, and even if i haven’t much time there, i shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish. i’d given one man and thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them. “you will sing with me? we go excellently well together. pickwick. wonder how old he is?” it was on the tip of jo’s tongue to ask, but she checked herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a round-about way. “get along, you fright!” screamed polly, and at that rude speech amy could not restrain a sniff. a fine view and a church tower opposite atone for the many stairs, and i took a fancy to my den on the spot. his music isn’t bad, but i hope he will do as well in more important things. bhaer. i shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate. amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity. “marmee, i want to ‘fess’. march gratefully, as her eyes went from her husband’s letter to beth’s smiling face, and her hand caressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her breast. ” “i agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go. please start it, mr. it isn’t safe in the middle. “i’m so full of happiness, that if father was only here, i couldn’t hold one drop more,” said beth, quite sighing with contentment as jo carried her off to the study to rest after the excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious grapes the ‘jungfrau’ had sent her. give me that unselfish nature, that with charity divine can pardon wrong for love’s dear sake— meek heart, forgive me mine! thus our parting daily loseth something of its bitter pain, and while learning this hard lesson, my great loss becomes my gain. then the all conquering tudor had danced four times with amy at a late party and only once with may—that was thorn number two. amy wants the rest of the page, so i must stop. my dear, it’s really dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her knees, and she can’t come to school. then you’d dash out as an heiress, scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my lady something in a blaze of splendor and elegance. you’ll go with us, of course? aunt will be charmed. the parlor windows were closed and curtained, no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with a distracting little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess, smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest. i felt bad and wanted you very much. she doesn’t look like my beth, and there’s nobody to help us bear it. go out more, keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no fair weather. “bless her heart! she pities him, so she is good to him,” said jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground. it’s nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but not to show off or get perked up,” said amy thoughtfully. it was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant people there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for one another. chapter four burdens “oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs and go on,” sighed meg the morning after the party, for now the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit her for going on easily with the task she never liked. teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his little fancy,” said jo, anxious to correct the professor’s mistake. she makes a good living out of such stories, they say. she stayed till hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general state of beatitude. mr. ” “but it’s dull at aunt march’s, and she is so cross,” said amy, looking rather frightened. “i shall have to toil and moil all my days, with only little bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly and sour, because i’m poor and can’t enjoy my life as other girls do. but the crowning joke was mr. boys make such a row, and my head is weak. “it’s a scrape, i acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand, we’ll pull through and have a good time yet. jo’s bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying experiments. march, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of placid despair. she rowed as well as she did many other things, and though she used both hands, and laurie but one, the oars kept time, and the boat went smoothly through the water. colonel teddy dear madam: the little girls are all well. “the good lady next door says he is studying too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise. winkle rose to say with great elegance, “we don’t wish any boys, they only joke and bounce about. he isn’t sentimental, doesn’t say much about it, but i see and feel it in all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that i don’t seem to be the same girl i was. you ought to marry well and help your family. if ever i do get my wish, you see what i’ll do for brooke. laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing meg at the window, seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. the correspondence flourished famously, and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity all through the early spring. we had a charming time poking about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his english wife. meg received his humble apology, and was much comforted by the assurance that brooke knew nothing of the joke. march’s motherly welcome, their cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of theirs. in a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she could not draw, and laurie’s voice said, with a droll imitation of a penitent child, “i will be good, oh, i will be good!” but amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping on the outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, “aren’t you ashamed of a hand like that? it’s as soft and white as a woman’s, and looks as if it never did anything but wear jouvin’s best gloves and pick flowers for ladies. amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was. annie moffat’s foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. “well, we’ll look at it. ” and amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath. “by the way, jo, i think that little parker is really getting desperate about amy. meg had a cushion,

aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat. i’m sorry. teddy thinks nothing too good for her,” returned jo with infinite satisfaction. john came home early, meg gadded no more, and that

people borrow, and can’t say ‘no’ to anyone. beth won’t be sick long, and hannah knows just what to do, and mother said we were to mind her, so i suppose we must, but it doesn’t seem quite right to me. ” “exactly. ” “you seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers, esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied. brooke. her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been

slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and jo’s nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head, which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die. i wish i hadn’t smashed my coral bracelet, for you might have had it,” said jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use. instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a sound, but the dash of fountains or the rustle of orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the hush, as count de adelon spoke thus: “my lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which i have gathered you here to witness the marriage of my daughter. i do not think that good young girls should see such things. you will get on the best, but i shall have the liveliest time of it. “some handkerchiefs, all hemmed,” said beth. come, i’ll be good. i haven’t words beautiful enough to describe it. oh, mother, i never knew how much like heaven this world could be, when two people love and live for one another!” “and that’s our cool, reserved, and worldly amy! truly, love does work miracles. mr. chester, who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter, said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look. “nor i,” echoed the others. a burnt offering has been made to vanity, this hardened palm has earned something better than blisters, and i’m sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long time, so much good will went into the stitches. ” there was a queer smile about mr. march, finding it difficult to become absorbed in his aristotle after the young couple had gone. brooke whenever they met, would sit looking at meg with a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner. i wonder you consented, amy, they only want you to work. oh, dear, i wish i hadn’t asked you to speak, mama,” said may, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.

day of my life. “here’s your posy, mother! laurie never forgets that,” she said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in ‘marmee’s corner’, and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy. the tidy basket, with the bit of work she left unfinished when the needle grew ‘so heavy’, was still on its accustomed shelf. you haf been ill, my friend?” he put the question abruptly, for, as jo hung up his coat, the light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it. she tried not to be envious or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments, and a happy life. “meg” on the first lid, smooth and fair. then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily embraced them all round, not forgetting the afflicted hannah, and ran downstairs as if for his life. “so!” he said, as i stopped and stared like a goose, “you peep at me, i peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, i am not pleasanting when i say, haf you a

she didn’t like the new tone, for though not blase, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look. ” with that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night. hat and coat were off, and every line of the active figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude was full of energy and meaning. march smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them. my child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them all if you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your heavenly father as you do that of your earthly one. t. ” said beth, ten days after mrs. he had simply said, in answer to her surprised inquiries as to the change,

notice is included. that moffat hasn’t been here, i hope?” asked mrs. ” “no, you won’t!” cried jo, hugging her close, with a frightened look. here’s meg married and a mamma, amy flourishing away at paris, and beth in love. when the girls saw that performance, jo began to dance a jig, by way of expressing her satisfaction, amy nearly fell out of the window in her surprise, and meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands, “well, i do believe the world is coming to an end. such trifles do escape the editorial mind, it is said. good night, doctor jo. it won’t help me, and it only makes it harder. act fourth displayed the despairing roderigo on the point of stabbing himself because he has been told that zara has deserted him. “i thank you, and come one more time before i go. her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully toward the window, but they fell on the old house opposite, and she shook her head with sorrowful decision. an enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving amy to entertain the hostess and mr. ” if meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she received it in the hearty pressure of her father’s hand and the approving smile he gave her. i don’t want to be worried about such things. amy was sketching a group of ferns, and jo was knitting as she read aloud. i don’t like reformers, and

“i’m going very fast, and he’s getting dearer every minute,” added jo to herself, then with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy that was pleasant to behold. this cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads semi-occasionally to ask, with interest, “does genius burn, jo?” they did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. ” “are you going to help about the fair, dear?” asked mrs. march with a look that warmed jo’s heart. laurence and aunt march shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three hebes carried round. “i’ve none to tell. but great plans fermented in her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which was one day to place the name of march upon the roll of fame. i’ll work and pray and fight against it. it’s very kind and respectful, but think how dreadful for me!” meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair, and jo tramped about the room, calling laurie names. laurence had insisted on giving it. “why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless you want to be thought mean, you must do it too. holding a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully, mrs. and mrs. “what do you hear from your mother?” asked the old lady gruffly. she was rather a favorite with ‘old davis’, as, of course, he was called, and it’s my private belief that he would have broken his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not found vent in a hiss. that’s about it, isn’t it, madame recamier?” asked laurie with a quizzical look at amy. then i’d do what i have often proposed, let hannah come and help you. amy and you changed places in my heart, that’s all. the girls are used to such things, and i want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though i do work for my living. the lady was good and lovely and accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after he married. “jo and i are going to make fortunes for you all. tomorrow i shall put away my ‘fuss and feathers’ and be desperately good again,” she answered with an affected little laugh. marmee is coming down the street, and laurie is tramping through the garden as if he had something nice to tell. poor jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing after another was tasted and left, while amy giggled, meg looked distressed, miss crocker pursed her lips, and laurie talked and laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive scene. “only trying to be neighborly, sir. “i never dreamed of such a thing. jo saw a big red headed youth approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy herself in peace. meg jumped up, looking both proud and shy, but ‘that man’, as jo called him, actually laughed and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, “sister jo, congratulate us!” that was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much, and making some wild demonstration with her hands, jo vanished without a word. “upon my word, i didn’t move it. but someone did pass, and who should it be but meg, looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival suit, for she had been making calls. it’s nothing to me, of course, but i should think he would have come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman,” she said to herself, with a despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for the customary walk one dull afternoon. laurie dashed downstairs for water, while meg and hannah supported her, and jo read aloud, in a frightened voice. here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in watching beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face. we won’t be miserable, but enjoy being together while we wait. if i wasn’t too old for such things, i’d rather like to play it over again,” said amy, who began to talk of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve. at sunset the tent was struck, hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole party floated down the river, singing at the tops of their voices. if this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on, in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the floor. amy’s face was full of trouble, but she only said, “don’t people put sort of postscripts to their wills, sometimes?” “yes, ‘codicils’, they call them. ” “well, i think truth is a very silly play. to be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman, and i sincerely hope my girls may know this beautiful experience. he was perfectly open and honorable about meg, for he told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before he asked her to marry him. brooke, looking cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, ned, mounted on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day. ‘up with the jib, reef the tops’l halliards, helm hard alee, and man the guns!’ roared the captain, as a portuguese pirate hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast. the fever flush and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that jo felt no desire to weep or to lament. but the lecture began to take effect, for there was a wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a half-angry, half-injured expression replaced the former indifference. “on the contrary, i like it very much, dear,” looking from the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely picture with its garland of evergreen. ” “pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful,” said laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently approved of. for the drops continued to fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she felt that, though it was too late to save her heart, she might her bonnet. she was the weaker then, and beth tried to comfort and sustain her, with her arms about her and the soothing words she whispered in her ear. presently jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid forth upon a large pillow. amy can stay and make herself useful if she isn’t sick, which i’ve no doubt she will be, looks like it now. during the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot. “well, that’s cool,” said laurie to himself, “to have a picnic and never ask me! they can’t be going in the boat, for they haven’t got the key. she hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things surprisin quick. meg wanted me to bring some of her blanc mange, she makes it very nicely, and beth thought her cats would be comforting. ” after a minute’s silence, he looked down at amy, who sat on the cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining hair. “you oughtn’t to be seen till the last minute, child. everyone likes and respects him, and i’m proud to think he cares for me, though i’m so poor and young and silly,” said meg, looking prettier than ever in her earnestness. but he got no chance to deliver it, for meg kept away from him till he came to say good night. i’ll gossip and giggle, and have horrors and raptures over any trifle you like. “i’ve got to stay for this confounded supper, but i shall be home early tomorrow. well, i needn’t be a sour saint nor a selfish sinner, and, i dare say, old maids are very comfortable when they get used to it, but. the women telegraphed their approval to one another, and mr. perhaps they forgot it. “she means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn’t matter. everyone was too busy with their own affairs to help her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order. the girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them as they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those. the ‘haughty, uninteresting creature’ was let severely alone, but amy’s talent and taste were duly complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it. no wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was droll enough to convulse a quaker, as he stood and stared wildly from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with such dismay that jo sat down on the floor and screamed. i say he may come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes. then his eyes would turn to jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered the mute inquiry if she had seen it. ” “now, mother, did you really think i could be so silly and selfish, after i’d refused his love, when it was freshest, if not best?” “i knew you were sincere then, jo, but lately i have thought that if he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like giving another answer. “you

remarkably plummy one. “hark!” cried jo, starting to her feet. i only loved you all the more, and i worked hard to please you, and i gave up billiards and everything you didn’t like, and waited and never complained, for i hoped you’d love me, though i’m not half good enough. uncle rushed out and bought a pair of dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an umbrella, and got shaved _à la_ mutton chop, the first thing. but i am not miss march, i’m only jo,” returned the young lady. with her pretty hair tucked into a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron which had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife fell to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for hadn’t she seen hannah do it hundreds of times? the array of pots rather amazed her at first, but john was so fond of jelly, and the nice little jars would look so well on the top shelf, that meg resolved to fill them all, and spent a long day picking, boiling, straining, and fussing over her jelly. i wish i could see you for a good talk, marmee. “i was trying to get something for meg, who is very tired, and someone shook me, and here i am in a nice state,” answered jo, glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove. “my castle is very different from what i planned, but i would not alter it, though, like jo, i don’t relinquish all my artistic hopes, or

corner. during the bustle jo had scarcely spoken but flown about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn, and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles. c. a lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and miss belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll. rest a little, and let me row. “’tis she!’ cried count gustave, and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy. ” they all drew to the fire, mother in the big chair with beth at her feet, meg and amy perched on either arm of the chair, and jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion if the letter should happen to be touching. i thought perhaps you’d had some news from home. he was tired of books, and found people so interesting now that mr. “now i must go and prepare mr. the pretty, modest girls are never talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman. everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud blown over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot it, meg remembered. i’m sorry, but i was so busy,” and meg’s tears began again. laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for several minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a momentary lull mrs. ” margaret sat thinking a moment, while jo stood with her hands behind her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it was a new thing to see meg blushing and talking about admiration, lovers, and things of that sort. dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure! how meg wouldn’t believe it till she saw the words. “want any more?” asked the old gentleman, looking grim and vexed, but trying not to show it. “you may have it, you may! only don’t stain it,

amy’s property, and departed, carefully scraping the mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook the dust of the place off her feet. “silence a la mort,” replied laurie, with a melodramatic flourish, as he went away. but it has blossomed in the night, and now i mean to put it in my vase here, so that when the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little rose, and mother’s face. “my dearest girl, what is the matter?” cried john, rushing in, with awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden. “yes, i am, and admiring the mole in your chin at the same time. tell her so. “i had a capital time. if it was cheap ugliness, i’d say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and i don’t get any satisfaction out of it. but, beth, i don’t give up yet. upon my word i will!” and laurie meant what he said. “tis whispered that she loves the young english artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned

crossest person in it!” returned amy, washing out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had fallen on her slate. ” “so i did, beth. why were you treated so?” “just because i wouldn’t say what your mother wanted me for. i don’t offer to take it myself, for i should only get into another scrape if i did. “i merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude for the honor done me, and

understand how any girl could help loving laurie, and hoped she would change her mind, but he knew even better than jo that love cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and resolved to carry his

and nobody shall worry her. not a very romantic story, but it interested me, and i was glad to hear that mrs. we are a set of rascals this morning, but we’ll come home regular angels. very few letters were written in those hard times that were not touching, especially those which fathers sent home. often she started up at night, thinking beth called her, and when the sight of the little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive sorrow, “oh, beth, come back! come back!” she did not stretch out her yearning arms in vain. ” “i hate my name, too, so sentimental! i wish every one would say jo instead of josephine. with many thanks, they said good night and crept in, hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but

twilight, prayed for beth, with streaming tears and an aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not console her for the loss of her gentle little sister. let your flowers hang, don’t

feeling in his throat and steadied his lips. “me wants me bhaer,” said the mite, slamming down her book and running to meet him. wouldn’t it be nice?” asked jo, looking up with a brighter face. she never thought of a will. seeing sallie’s pretty things made her long for such, and pity herself because she had not got them. i can’t stop here, for the house is full. ” “i can’t thrash aunt march, so i suppose i shall have to bear it. if he asked her to deliver a latin oration, it would not have seemed a more impossible task to bashful beth, but there was no place to run to, no jo to hide behind

new member—one who highly deserves the honor, would be deeply grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit of the club, the literary value of the paper, and be no end jolly and nice. for it was one, jo, as you said, and i found it out, after making a fool of myself. it didn’t much matter, for mr. she listened to college stories with deep interest, caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily that “tom brown was a brick,” regardless of the improper form of praise, and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank, she went with an alacrity which caused mamma to

of an inspired frenchwoman. i’m getting too old for such things,” observed meg, who was as much a child as ever about ‘dressing-up’ frolics. like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters and scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as much accuracy and spirit as could be expected. ” “isn’t ‘thou’ a little sentimental?” asked jo, privately thinking it a lovely monosyllable. “i ought to be satisfied to please grandfather, and i do try, but it’s working against the grain, you see, and comes hard.

to wear them. k. i mean it shall, if i live to work out my plans,” said mr. jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first words she saw were. lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded professor gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry bass viol. this was the first serious disagreement, her own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor john coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart. you won’t have anything else here. such delightful times as we are having! sight-seeing from morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay _cafes_, and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures. there’s plenty of

in spite of manful efforts to conceal the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote a note to her mother. beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home. “good girl! call meg, and tell her you’ll give in,” said laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed amy more than the ‘giving in’. when they got into the hall, jo asked laurie if she had said something amiss. what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out. please don’t forget amy’s napkin. next our peaceful tupman comes, so rosy, plump, and sweet, who chokes with laughter at the puns, and tumbles off his seat. also my $100, to do what he likes with. “yes, mother, perfectly

woman. “what have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?” was the next question, sharply put. “not a first attempt, i take it?” observing that the pages were numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied up with a ribbon—sure sign of a novice. the children were inconsolable, and mr. i’m not a fool. i only moaned a trifle to keep the girls company. fortunately the story was _the constant tin soldier_, which is droll, you know, so i could laugh, and i did, though i didn’t understand half he read, for i couldn’t help it, he was so earnest, i so excited, and the whole thing so comical. “i thought you’d do it,” said mrs. the walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. “did the german song suit, miss march?” inquired mr. ” when they had laughed at beth’s story, they asked their mother for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, “as i sat cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, i felt very anxious about father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should be, if anything happened to him. bhaer got hold of them?” jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze. “i’ve got my new pink silk for thursday and

infirm dolls. it will make fun, and i don’t mind being a guy if i’m comfortable. i planned it, and she only gave in after lots of teasing. “now let’s fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can play tomorrow with free minds,” said jo, preparing to replace her pen with a broom. i have no fears for you, yet i am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. she was rather surprised, therefore, when the silence remained unbroken, and jo assumed a patronizing air, which decidedly aggravated meg, who in turn assumed an air of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother. i had a feeling that something was going to happen and i was ready for it. jo wasn’t ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on her mother’s shoulder and sobbed out, “i am a selfish girl! but i’ll truly try to be better, so he mayn’t be disappointed in me by-and-by. “the girls do care for me, and i for them,

after a summary cleaning up, she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for john to come and be forgiven. these turnovers were an institution, and the girls called them ‘muffs’, for they had no others and found the hot pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings. you always have things to suit you. aunt march saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a fresh start, saying as mildly as she could, “now, meg, my dear, be reasonable and take my advice. it was pleasant, for in dull weather meg often felt lonely. give my dearest love to father, and believe me, ever your own. but jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first. it was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. next week we are off to germany and switzerland, and as we shall travel fast, i shall only be able to give you hasty letters. it’s a splendid idea. ” “i wish i could, and be done with it,”

present. laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the dovecote one saturday, with an excited face, and was received with the clash of cymbals, for hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one and the cover in the other. we’ll have capital times after she is gone, for i shall be through college before long, and then we’ll go abroad on some nice trip or other. jo can’t prevent my seeing her, and

remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your first care was to keep it so. ” and jo looked a little queer likewise, for a name had almost escaped her. i’m interested in other people’s experiences and inconsistencies, and though i can’t explain, i remember and use them for my own benefit. her respect and regard for the ‘laurence’ boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well and didn’t put on any airs. you could make a charming thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you know. it came at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for jo

to open a school for little lads—a good, happy, homelike school, with me to take care of them and fritz to teach them. ” jo’s cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what he thought of her, but she didn’t care, for in a minute she found herself walking away arm in arm with her professor, feeling as if the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that the world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman was paddling through the wet that day. five years after jo’s wedding, one of these fruitful festivals occurred, a mellow october day, when the air was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise and the blood dance healthily in the veins. ” “just listen to me a minute, and be a good child,” said meg soothingly. ” mrs. “yes’m. beth’s new

mischievous meaning in his merry black eyes that beth suddenly turned very red, and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such an unexpected discovery. ” interrupted jo, with a grateful kiss. ” and meg laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she thus described her supposed lover. ” and beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look, which

me all about belle moffat’s wedding. my faith! wasn’t it love among the roses!” laurie seemed to forget jo for a minute, and jo was glad of it, for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten. ” she answered, “i’ll take it,” and it was cut off and paid for, and sallie had exulted, and she had laughed as if it were a thing of

smashed in the door, went up a pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics, miss march. it so happened that she could not have done a better thing, for laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the

fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since jo persisted in being stonyhearted. i’ve begun to model a figure of baby, and laurie says it is the best thing i’ve ever done. it cost him no effort to be generous, and he would have given amy all the trinkets in nice if she would have taken them, but at the same time he felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of him, and he rather

face, as if regretting his own lost youth, as he watched the young man in his prime. “now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,” implored jo, almost at her wit’s end. ” laying her head on her arms, jo wet her little romance with a few happy tears, for she had thought that no one saw and appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly precious, doubly

and earnest to be lightly spoken. meg cheerfully blackened and burned her white hands cooking delicate messes for ‘the dear’, while amy, a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept. meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure, and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke. “what did mother give you out of the treasure box?” asked amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which mrs. they are not so wild and handsome, but they seem happy, confiding little
