Etymology
The word nature is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word or innate and in ancient literally meant In ancient natura is mostly used as the Latin translation of the Greek word physis which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics of and other features of the world to develop of their own The concept of nature as a the physical is one of several expansions of the original it began with certain core applications of the word by philosophers this word had a dynamic dimension especially for and has steadily gained currency ever

Geology is the science and study of the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the The field of geology encompasses the study of the physical and history of Earth and the processes by which they are and The field is a major academic and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon knowledge about and mitigation of natural some Geotechnical engineering and understanding past climates and

Geological evolution

Three types of geological plate tectonic boundaries
The geology of an area evolves through time as rock units are deposited and inserted and deformational processes change their shapes and

Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrude into the overlying Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava blanket the Igneous intrusions such as and push upwards into the overlying and crystallize as they

After the initial sequence of rocks has been the rock units can be deformed Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal horizontal or These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent divergent and transform between tectonic

Historical perspective
Main History of the Earth and Evolution

An animation showing the movement of the continents from the separation of Pangaea until the present day
Earth is estimated to have formed billion years ago from the solar along with the Sun and other The Moon formed roughly million years Initially the outer layer of the Earth resulting in the solid Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial Condensing water most or all of which came from ice delivered by produced the oceans and other water The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a molecule around billion years


Plankton inhabit seas and and have existed in various forms for at least billion
Continents then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of occasionally combining to make a Roughly million years the earliest known supercontinent began to break The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about million years then finally which broke apart about million years

During the Neoproterozoic freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice This hypothesis has been termed the and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about million years

Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass The last mass extinction occurred some million years when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs and other large but spared small animals such as Over the past million mammalian life

Several million years a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand The subsequent advent of human and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global By the Great Oxygenation produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian required about million years to

The atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by Air is mostly water with much smaller amounts of carbon The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet radiation that reaches the As DNA is readily damaged by UV this serves to protect life at the The atmosphere also retains heat during the thereby reducing the daily temperature

Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the and serves as a convective system for redistributing Ocean currents are another important factor in determining particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature between winter and summer in the temperate without the redistributions of heat energy by the ocean currents and the tropics would be much and the polar regions much

Main Evolution
The origin of life on Earth is not well but it is known to have occurred at least billion years during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at These life forms possessed the basic traits of and inheritable Once life had the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of diverse life

Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life

When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called Cells within colonies became increasingly resulting in true multicellular With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet life colonized the surface of

Among the many ways of classifying plants are by regional depending on the purpose of can also include fossil remnants of plant life from a previous People in many regions and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic which can vary widely across the globe due to differences in climate and

Regional floras commonly are divided into categories such as native flora or agricultural and garden Some types of actually have been introduced centuries ago by people migrating from one region or continent to and become an integral part of the or natural flora of the place to which they were This is an example of how human interaction with nature can blur the boundary of what is considered

Another category of plant has historically been carved out for Though the term has fallen into disfavor among botanists as a formal way to categorize the informal use of the word to describe those plants that are deemed worthy of elimination is illustrative of the general tendency of people and societies to seek to alter or shape the course of animals are often categorized in ways such as farm wild according to their relationship to human

Aesthetics and beauty

Aesthetically pleasing flowers
Beauty in nature has historically been a prevalent theme in art and filling large sections of libraries and That nature has been depicted and celebrated by so much and other literature shows the strength with which many people associate nature and Reasons why this association and what the association consists are studied by the branch of philosophy called Beyond certain basic characteristics that many philosophers agree about to explain what is seen as the opinions are virtually Nature and wildness have been important subjects in various eras of world An early tradition of landscape art began in China during the Tang Dynasty The tradition of representing nature as it is became one of the aims of Chinese painting and was a significant influence in Asian

Although natural wonders are celebrated in the Psalms and the Book of wilderness portrayals in art became more prevalent in the especially in the works of the Romantic British artists John Constable and Turner turned their attention to capturing the beauty of the natural world in their Before paintings had been primarily of religious scenes or of human William poetry described the wonder of the natural which had formerly been viewed as a threatening Increasingly the valuing of nature became an aspect of Western This artistic movement also coincided with the Transcendentalist movement in the Western A common classical idea of beautiful art involves the word the imitation of Also in the realm of ideas about beauty in nature is that the perfect is implied through perfect mathematical forms and more generally by patterns in As David Rothenburg beautiful is the root of science and the goal of the highest possibility that humanity can ever hope to
